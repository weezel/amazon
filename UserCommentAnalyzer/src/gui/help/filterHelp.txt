Expressions of the following shape are used to filter the keyword list:

[_] ( [_] ... [_] )

Where “[_]” denotes a keyword of a certain type, and ( [_] ... [_] ) denotes an
optional arbitrary amount of additional keywords to be matched.

The following types of expressions are available:

[*]         ->      This keyword can be of any kind. No filtering is applied.
[+]         ->      This keyword can be of any kind, but the keywords are
                    filtered by stop words.
[a]         ->      This keyword must be an adjective.
[c]         ->      This keyword must be a connection word.
[;string]   ->      This keyword must be equal to the word given by string.
                    This enables the user to make any kind of combination of
                    keywords.
