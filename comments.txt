Header: The CX300-B Earbuds - Decent Sound, Average Build, Good Value, December 30, 2008
Comment:
The Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds are far from perfect but given the low cost might offer one of the better values in earbuds out there. I needed an extra for myself, and I have been testing a bunch of buds recently. In the end, I decided on these despite their weaknesses because given the low selling cost of less than 50% of list price I thought they were good enough to have as my extra pair. Now the first thing that people do need to be aware of is that these are asymmetrical, which means one side is longer than the other. This is designed so that the cord can go behind your head. That leads to less pulling on the buds, which leads to less cord noise. All budget earbuds have some level of cord noise, but by wrapping the cord around your ear and behind your head you can minimize it pretty well with these. The second factor is that the fit of the tips will be very important for comfort. These tips are not the highest quality out there, but they will do. Those with smaller ear canals should be able to get by with the smallest included size. But if those are still not small enough for you you probably will have to step up to the Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones which also have even smaller ear plugs sold seperately. In that case you are talking about 5 times the price, so that's only for those who really have a hard time getting a good fit or are looking for much higher quality. I burned these in over a few days and overall I am happy with the sound. It's not fantastic, but relative to the price I think the performance is adequate. The main gripe I have is around the durability of the wires which definitely feel very suspect. Unlike most other sennheisers I have purchased these had no case included, so I used the case from my Sennheiser MX55 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Headphones which actually is much better designed for these. Some people don't like the 90 degree plug, but I prefer it. I could tell already though that the plug will not hold up to a lot of use so handle gently. These are a good compromise for the price but should not be your primary set of earbuds unless you are not picky at all. If you need something good to commute with and block out the bus or train noise, this is it. If you need something for very small ear canals or want premium quality sound, you will probably do good to consider some other options. Enjoy.

Header: Awesome Earbuds...for a while..., September 4, 2007
Comment:
My wife got me a pair of these earbuds for Christmas last year and I have to say that I loved them. The sound quality is amazing, they're very comfortable, and they block a lot of noise. The noise blocking, like I said, was very impressive. With my stock earbuds, I was often running my mp3 player at 18-25 volume, depending upon outside noise. With these, I was generally running at 5-8. I'm sure that was better for my ears. So what's with the two star rating? Well, In about 6 months, I went through 4 pairs of these earbuds. They'd work great for about a month and then one of the earbuds would stop producing much sound. I'd have to turn the volume up from 5 to 25 to get anything out of that one earbud and, if I did that, the other one would be so loud that I couldn't use them. They were under manufacturer warranty, so I'd send them back and get a new pair and they'd work great, for about a month. I did this a few times and, like I said, I went through 4 pairs in a span of 6 months. Even though they were still under warranty, I finally got fed up with the process and just tossed 'em out. So, like I said, they were great for a little while. Unfortunately, I didn't have much luck in terms of reliability.

Comment:
I read the previous reviews prior to purchase, so will try not to replow too much of that ground. These buds work well for me, with good sound if you get a decent seal between the silicone rubber adaptor and your ear. After some experimentation, I found the mediums work best for me, and I can wear them for several hours at a time without feeling uncomfortable. One tip: Watching a NASCAR pre-race interview, I noticed Jeff Burton really slobbering up his ear pieces to ease insertion. I found that with just a little moisture applied to the rubber with one's finger, it both goes in more reliably and doesn't give you the "wet willy" feel. Once inserted properly, two things: The bass response is pleasing and the wife can prattle on to her heart's content and I can't hear a word. This with my Creative flash player's volume set at the low end, about 5. You'll still need muffs when working with a router or lawn mower, but the buds do a nice job of isolating a lot of the noise. Don't even think of running a Sonicare with the buds in! Trust me on that one. Yes, the wires are a bit stiff, but they don't tangle. However, as others have noted, even walking in a stiff breeze you can hear the whistle from the wires. I have them tucked under a T-shirt so only a few inches is exposed on each side. Also, I thought I'd prefer the "J" cord, with the right ear wire about double the length of the left, as I wear the player on my left arm. In hind sight, given both the stiffness of the wire and the fact I'm wearing them under the shirt, perhaps that wasn't the best choice as I have a heck of a time keeping the left bud in and the right wire not running wild. Not a major fault, but something to consider. The choice appears to me to come down to these Senns or the Shures. A cousin loves his Shures, and they do come with foam adaptors in addition to the silicone rubber. They are a few bucks more. I'm happy with my selection of the Senns, but can't state for sure if I'd be more or less happy with the Shures.

Header: Nice sound and extra wire length, January 14, 2007
Comment:
As others have said, these earbuds give much higher fidelity sound that the ones that came with my iPod 80gB, and they are not prone to fall out of position in my ears when walking or running. The sound is not as high quality, however, as a good pair of over the ear headphones. Small, medium, and large rubber cones are provided... use the set that fits your ear the best. With a good seal in the ear canal, a lot of external background noise disappears, but you can still hear a car horn or a bicyle ringer on the trail; it doesn't make you deaf to the world. One problem is that when you walk or run on a windy day, it sounds like the wind is whistling through the stays of a ship at sea... very annoying. Also, you have to secure the wire close to your neck by running it under your shirt or by other means; if you have a long length of wire flopping around you will hear a thump each time it bounces around. The wire length of the earbuds that came with the iPod is 45". The CX 300 wire is longer, so that I, at 6 feet height and relatively long torso, can keep the iPod in my pants pocket, or even in the thigh pocket on my cargo pants. The cord length is asymetrical so that the length to the left earbud is 53 inches, and 60 inches to the right. This design presumes your iPod is in a left pocket. The extra length allows the right earbud to run behind your head to the ear without putting a strain on the cord... it seems stupid, but actually it works well.

Comment:
I ordered these CX300s after my second pair of Sonys died. I loved the fit of the EX51 and EX71 Sonys and put up with their adequate sound for the isolation and comfort they offer. What I couldn't put up with any more is their fragility. I received maybe 1 year's service out of 2 pair of Sony phones and I refused to give them any more of my money. When I saw these Sennheisers with a similar design as the Sonys I was excited as I have two other sets of Sennheiser (over the ear) phones which are excellent. Well, I'm not disapointed. These are more accurate and articulate than the Sonys and have much better bass without getting muddy. They fit as well as the Sonys and have a symmetrical cord*, which I prefer and believe will improve their durability as compared to the Sonys which always fail on the left (short cord) side. I can't speak to the durability of these phones as I've had them only a few days but they COULD NOT be worse than Sonys that are certain to fail quickly. I've seen a few posts that criticize these phones for their poor bass response. I suspect these people have not tried fitting the different rubber gaskets to attain a proper fit. I did this and the sound quality difference is amazing. These phones also seem more efficient than the Sonys as they are louder at a lower setting. My point of reference here has (obviously) been the Sony EX51s and EX71s as they are of similar (in ear) design that I find very welcome when out on the street for their abilty to isolate one from ambient noise. These are not IMO, replacements for a good set of over the ear phones when in a quiet environment. That's not a knock on these specific phones as I don't believe any "in ear" design can compare with good over the ear phones. Highly recommended! Update: subsequent to my writing this I've come to learn that I purchased (through an Amazon associate vendor) the generic version of these earphones. They have the same drivers and gaskets, but a different cord* and no Sennheiser logo. After this was thoroughly explained to me, I'm fine with it as this version of "Sennheiser CX300Bs" have a Y cord and not the asymmetrical cord which so many of us have come to dislike.

Header: Great earbuds for the price, May 20, 2009
Comment:
I collect headphones, and am finally getting around to writing a review for some of them on Amazon. I devised a way to test them, using six songs from a range of genres, and a 1 - 10 rating scale for each element I reviewed. The songs I chose were "The Chain" by Fleetwood Mac, "Every Planet We Reach Is Dead" by Gorillaz, "Concerto No. 26 in D Major" by Handel, "I Know You Are, But What Am I?" by Mogwai, "Afro Blue" by Triplexity, and "The Patient" by Tool. Each song was encoded in 192 kbps or higher Ogg Vorbis and played from an iAudio 7 with all sound effects switched off and the equalizer set to flat. Now to my review... Sound Quality(7.2/10) The Chain(7.5/10) - moderately exaggerated bass, but pleasant treble and mid tones. Fairly crisp and smooth. Good instrument separation. Relatively shallow sound stage. Every Planet(8/10) - nice, clean, punchy bass, with smooth mid tones. Highs are a little bright. Lacking in sound stage. Concerto(7.5/10) - crisp and smooth mid tones and treble. Instrument separation is decent, but sound stage is very small. I Know You Are(7/10) - clean, deep bass, pleasant highs, good instrument separation, but narrow sound stage and mediocre mid tones. Slight distortion at times. The Patient(6/10) - clean but exaggerated bass. Instrument separation decent, but not overly great. Treble is also a bit bright, and sound stage is lacking. Mid tones, however, were smooth and pleasing. Afro Blue(7/10) - tiny sound stage. But deep, clean bass, smooth highs, and vibrant mid tones. Instrument separation is not excellent, but fair. Overall Sound(7.2/10) - sound quality on these is solid and above average. The bass is moderately exaggerated, but actually quite clean, despite the exaggeration. Distortion is fairly minimal. The treble is also slightly bright, but not so much that it causes listening fatigue. Mid tones are smooth and vibrant, but bass is where these shine- it is somewhat exaggerated, but otherwise clean and pleasant to listen to. Their largest weaknesses was sound stage, which was very two-dimensional. Instrument separation is decent, especially for this price range, but don't expect wonders. Good for listening to most musical genres except heavier variations of rock, like progressive metal. Design(8/10) These are a cross between earbuds and canalphones, and thus are ultra small and mobile. You can easily stuff them in your pocket along with your PMP and carry them wherever you go. The cord is designed to hang around the back of your neck so that it stays out of the way. The styling is simple, with sort of an understated elegance to it. They are very comfortable, and can easily be warn for hours on end. They also seem fairly durable - as previously indicated, I stuff them in my pocket on the go, and they still function perfectly after having them for almost six months. Noise Isolation(7/10) While these don't cancel noise actively, they have a fairly large amount of noise isolation due to the in-ear design. Excellent for blocking ambient, background noise, but I doubt they would be particularly effective at alleviating noise from a jet engine. The noise they leak is minimal, so you won't have to worry about annoying the people around you when using these. Bottom Line(7.3/10) I feel these are a good value for the price. Maybe not the best sounding earbuds in this price range, but they still sound good; the best I've personally heard for the money. They're comfortable, durable, and highly mobile. However, opinions on headphones vary wildly according to personal taste, and I always recommend listening to many different pairs before buying(although this isn't always possible with earbuds).

Header: V-Moda who? Or, how to step up from the Sony MDR-EX71/81., July 10, 2007
Comment:
With a range of iPods and MP3 phones, I've mainly used Sony MDR-EX71 and -EX81, and most recently, V-Moda Vibe. EX71s are very comfortable and excel at sound isolation. They also offer acceptable sound quality, but with overly "boomy" bass and almost shrill treble. EX81s maintain the 71s' strong points while improving on the 71s' bass and treble, but only slightly. Furthermore, the over-the-ear hook design is somewhat difficult (especially with sun/glasses). The Vibes offered nearly as much comfort as the EX71s together with excellent aesthetics, materials, and construction. But they lack thorough sound isolation, and even after 4 weeks' use, continued to attenuate the lowest bass and highest treble notes. Which led me to the CX300-Bs. Only 1 day of use so far, and they already have 99% of the EX71s' comfort, 100% of the EX71s' sound isolation, and 110% of the EX81s' sound quality. Which is to say, all notes sound tight and accurate: lows and highs are just slightly nuanced (so you know they're there, unlike V-Moda), while mids are slightly distant but otherwise loud'n'clear. I expect all of this to improve with more break-in. Sennheiser lost 1 star for two reasons. First, the packaging is insanely impossible to open - I nearly lost the different sizes of included eartips trying to open these. And, they lack any form of carrying case, which Sony provides with headphones costing half as much.

Header: Great headphones with some tweaking, October 22, 2006
Comment:
The two minor problems with these inner-ear monitors is the noise of the cord and the shape of the cord. Each issue is easily fixed: 1. The simplest way to fix the cord noise is to put a cheap cord clip (like from a cell phone headset) on the cord and attach it to the left shoulder. This seems to ground the cord and reduces noise to a minimum even when running. 2. The shape of the cord is not so strange when used correctly. Just by chance I put in the left plug and wrapped the right around the back of my neck and put the right plug in my ear from behind. Not only did this reduce noise from the cord swaying, it also made it very convenient when you take the plugs out when you need to hear outside noise. The phones, the left hanging on your left shoulder and the right hanging around the back of the neck and down the right shoulder, rest comfortably and make it convenient to grab and replace in the ear. Honestly, I believe these are the best iem for the money. I have tried the shure e3c, e2, sony 51, 71, koss buds, apple in-ear and standard, and several others. As for fit, ease of placement, listening longevity, sound, and price, these are the best for me. I am thoroughly impressed and the Senn cx300's are my new EDC phones. B

Comment:
I was a big fan of Sennheiser having owned and loved the HD-600 headphones for years. These, however, do not sound noticeably different than the stock iPod headphones and have one fatal flaw, the cord is a hard plastic and any physical contact with the cord transmits a sound straight to the ear. I am using them right now as I type this review. Just moving my head slightly creates a loud rustling sound in my ear. I am ordering a pair of Shure EC2s right now, maybe I'll have better luck with those. Bad.

Header: Excelent music device, May 26, 2006
Comment:
This is my first experience with the IEM technology. I got them to replace the "earbuds" that came with my IAudio G3 which I found to be very unconfortable and actually very painful to wear. After quite a bit of research on various headphone forums and of music hardware reviews I decided to take a chance on the Senn CX300's. I have had them for a few weeks now and they are the greatest little devices since flash MP3 players themselves. Through my research I discovered that the ear tips were interchangeable with IEMs from other manufacturers such as Sony, Shure, and Ultimate Ears (ear tips are sold separately by various vendors including the just mentioned manufacturers). Although they sound and fit great right out of the box, experimentation with different ear tips will provide you with the ideal fit, comfort, and sound response -- since everyone has unique ear shapes, sensitivity, and tastes for sound frequency response. I think they fit and sound best for me with shapable foam tips although I'm still experimenting with various tips. Some people complain that the CX300's have too much bass or not enough bass ... I have learned that all IEMs require you take the time to fit them into your ear canal just right in order to get the frequency response that these devices are capable of. Another often cited complaint is the "J" style cord ... the left side is half as short as the right before they merge together. I think the purpose of this style is to wear the cord behind your ears and around the back of your neck in order to minimize the "stethoscope" noise characteristic of all IEMs where the cord may rub against your clothes and tranfer a low rumble noise to your ears. I have not found this to be a big problem fo me unless there is a silent pause from my IEMs while I'm also moving around a lot. I have read that some are able to further minimize this rumble by using a clip like those used for IEM/microphones that come with cell phones. The price appears to vary here on Amazon anywhere from just under $40 to just under $60 ... so make your purchase accordingly. Regardless, I would value them over $80 since they provided me with exactly what I was looking for. They are very light weight and compact, they are very comfortable, they do a good job of isolating outside noise from getting in and an even better job of keeping music from leaking out, and they sound awsome, -- which works great for my bus commute to and from the office. From what I have read on various forums, there is a significant diminishing return when purchasing more expensive IEMs and have read posts from people that have made actual comparisons that the CX300's have a surperior sound response to the more expensive Shure E2c and the Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 3 IEMs. I would highly recomend the CX300 IEMs. Just make sure to take the time to fit them correctly into your ears before making a final evaluation.

Header: Compared to the Etymotic Research ER-4Ps..., July 27, 2006
Comment:
I've had Etymotic Research's ER-4Ps for about five years now, and absolutely love love love them. Terrific product. I sent them out to www.fixup.net (back when that site did this swap) to swap out the cable to something not as bad microphonically, and after that the ER-4Ps haven't gone more than three or four days without use in the course of those five years. Well, excepting once. When the right transducer experienced a fatigue failure while in my ear canal. Was rather embarassing for me to ask my then-girlfriend to take a set of tweezers and remove the darn thing, but she did a fine job. And despite the fact that they were about six months out of warranty, the Etymotic folks did a better-than-fine job of replacing/repairing (I couldn't tell which) the broken unit for only the price of shipping. And that excellent service included direct email communication with the technician who actually carried out the servicing. Top-notch service, and enough to make me a vocal Etymotic supporter. However, now the left-bud is exhibiting some very serious attenuation, and I can see another mailing off to Illinois is in order. But based on my last experience, I can't live without having something in the interim, and so a quick Amazon Prime-prompted purchase of the CX 300Bs was in order. While I only expected them to carry me through a brief black-out period while my ER-4Ps are being serviced, I have the feeling that they're going to be seeing some fairly regular usage. Believe me, no one is more surprised by that than me. The ER-4Ps have top-notch sound. But where they lack is in the convenience factor. I use the foam ear-tips (that expand in the ear-canal) which are somewhat of a PITA to put in and take out. The Sennheiser buds, on the other hand, go in and out with the greatest of ease. If I'm in an environment where I may need to pause the music, the CX 300Bs are going to be my first choice. Where the ER-4Ps still excel are environments where outside noise is an issue (think air travel), or where cable microphonics may be an issue (exercising). The CX 300Bs are the choice if I'm to be resting in bed (P. Kowalsky's wiki article at the bottom of the page is spot-on), if they may have to go in-and-out of the ears with any regularity (I'm listening at home with my wife and/or daughter around, or I'm at work), or if I need to be cognizant of say the telephone (work, again). Clearly the ER-4Ps provide a truer response than the CX 300Bs, but the CX 300Bs do not make me cringe or otherwise distort the output to any bothersome degree. Honestly, depending on the music you're listening to, the low-frequency boost may be a welcome change after listening to the flat response of a more precision transducer. An unqualified recommendation for the CX 300Bs. And FWIW I do not give out unqualified recommendations for those (I always have to warn potential buyers of the PITA involved with fitting them in your ears, and basically shutting off your sense of sound to the world around you once they're in).

Header: Fantastic headphones at this price!!!!, May 13, 2006
Comment:
Do not believe the negative reviews. The only way these buds don't deliver great sound is if you do not know how to put them on. You have to achieve a sealing effect to get the bass, but once you get them on correctly...wow! I guess it is possible that people have weird ears in which these buds won't fit...but it comes with three sizes that should work for 99% of the population. For the price, these things deliver sound like you spent $100. Great bargain! The sound is clear, and the bass is strong, but not overbearing. Overall very pleasant sound to these headphones. At first I was not a big fan of the asymetrical cord until I realized the right cord is made to go around the back of your head. Now I am a fan because you do not have to go traveling about with a big cord dangling in front of you. The wrap around the back of your head cord stays out of your way. The cord is microphonic, meaning that you can hear when something rubs up against the cord. This is just something that happens with virtually all ear canal headphones. With that being said, the microphonic effect on this set is minimal. Again, fantastic quality and sound for the price! The negative reviews are from folks that don't know how to put them on, or have weird shaped ears that don't accomodate in ear phones.

As a commuter I needed a set of good noise canceling earbuds (cover subway sounds). The CX300-B are above average at canceling noise, but unfortunately they create noise whenever the cord touches anything. I'm not sure how anyone could rate them high, as the cord noise is ridiculous and irritating. I found the Klipsch Image S4 to be a superb set, with great noise canceling, and high audio quality. Spend the extra money to get a quality product the first time around, so you don't end up wasting money on the CX300-B.

Comment:
The sound quality is good, the external noise blocking is good, fit is decent, but durability is non-existent. After using these all of about 15 times or so, I noticed the sound had become muffled and weak in one of the earbuds. I sent them back to Sennheiser and they sent me a brand new pair under warranty no questions asked (thumbs up on their customer service). I took extra care with the replacement and handled them as delicately as possible, taking care to never pull on the wires, or bang them around or subject them to any other abuse. However, after a month of so of use, same problem as the first pair. Sound is dead in one earbud and muffled in the other. Stay away from these headphones. They sound good at first, but fall apart fairly quickly even when treated gingerly. This is a disposable product.

Header: Disappointed with CX-300, August 7, 2007
Comment:
I researched these thoroughly before I bought them. I have other Sennheiser products that I really like. I read that other users have had some problems and complaints mostly with the quality and others with the cord noise. I am very careful with my stuff and with my previous experience with Sennheiser, I really didn't think quality was going to be an issue and it hasn't been so far. So I thought OK, how bad can the cord noise be?? Well, its BAD. Extremely annoying to me. Right out of the box, its the first thing you notice. Even if you wear the J-cord the way its supposed to be worn, the cord rubs against your collar and front of your shirt, and makes a pronounced deep rubbing noise. You hear it over the music (even if turned up) and it is quite distracting. It seems to be more when it rubs fabric than skin. On skin the noise is not quite as bad. The only time you won't get any noise is if you stay perfectly still while wearing these, which is very unrealistic. And I don't mean jogging or exercising, I'm talking about just bobbing your head to the music or looking down at your iPod or cell phone. When the cord moves at all, you hear it. So cord noise IS that BAD and it was a big strike one against these buds. However, the sound is really pretty good, especially the bass on most on most types of music. I am certain I have inserted them correctly and got a good tight seal. The bass is as advertised, really, really good. By the way, a note to other reviewers, low frequency is called "BASS" not "BASE". Anyway, lows are good and surprisingly the highs are also very good. The bass is clean and does not overshadow the highs in most cases. They sound "Bright" so to speak. BUT what I noticed is that mid-range is not as good. If you listen to Jazz vocals or pop vocal(say Diana Krall or Kelly Clarkson) for example, you have to change the EQ on your iPod to pump up the treble and kill some of the bass to really be able to hear her voice. Of course, you can't listen to it that way for long, that just kills your ears and really it sounds somewhat artificial. Mid range is just dark and muddy. On jazz and pop vocals the bass on these babies tends to become way too pronounced and kills what little mids there are. It really shows up the weakness in these buds. I noticed one reader said that "CX-300 tends to have problems with music where there is alot going on", classic rock for example. I also found that to be true. But as you can imagine with the clean bass and bright highs, electronic and house music sounds outstanding!! Smooth jazz is quite passable as is hip-hop and R&B. If those are the only types of music you listen to AND you also happen to be confined to a wheel chair or a neck brace and can't move too much then these would definitely be the buds for you! I really wanted to like these and I got what I considered a good deal - 59.99 at Circuit City. I avoided Amazon for these since I saw that many readers had gotten poor quality or even knock offs from some sellers. I wanted to be absolutely sure of what I was getting and was willing to pay a little more for the peace of mind and no hassle return if needed. Overall, I am very disappointed. I am taking them back. More because of the cord noise than anything else. I think for the money I paid, the sound is about right. If the cord noise were not so pronounced, I could definitely live with them for $59 even with the weak mids. Hey, I know these aren't high end audiophile buds and I'm not an audiophile. But I know what sounds good to me. Maybe the next version from Sennheiser will address the cord noise and if so, then I would recommend these for the price. But I cannot recommend, not as they are today. Anyway, I have been looking into the E2Cs. I haven't seen anything about cord noise on those. Some readers say the noise is just worse on the Senns. The reviews on the E2Cs indicate that the mid range is more clear on those. They would likely be a better match for me and my music & ears. Will probably spring for the E2Cs and give them a try when I have the opportunity or can catch them on sale.

I've just bought the headphones and as many here, have had high expectations. Well, what can I say - first of all you do have to insert them deep inside your ear canal as was mentioned in several reviews - otherwise you don't have any bass at all. Like NO BASS. But the moment you insert them deep in your ear - yes, the negative reviews state it absolutely honest and clear - your every motion transmits the sound of the wires scratching right into your ear amplified... I can't say it's a _very_ big issue, but it's an issue nevertheless. It is very audible. But even if you've done everything right - and are not moving... Well, I'd say the bass is still a bit too thin. The sound of the phones is not cheap. It is ok... But street-styled PMX60 are better, imho. And cheaper, by the way. Overall... I got the phones for less than 30$ and I'm satisfied. But I would not buy them for more. And I'm not sure, if I'd buy them for 30$ if I knew everything before.

Header: Very poorly engineered--do not buy!, January 14, 2010
Comment:
This product is incredibly poorly designed. Like many, I use these earphones to listen to music while working out. The cord design is so poor that you hear incredibly loud and annoying sounds every time the cord brushes against you. I've never had this problem with other earphones, and it's so annoying that I'd be much better off listening to the much cheaper earphones that came with my MP3. I really regret wasting my $ on this product and strongly advise against buying it. I can't believe Sennheiser engineering is this bad!
