Header: The CX300-B Earbuds - Decent Sound, Average Build, Good Value, December 30, 2008
Comment:
The Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds are far from perfect but given the low cost might offer one of the better values in earbuds out there. I needed an extra for myself, and I have been testing a bunch of buds recently. In the end, I decided on these despite their weaknesses because given the low selling cost of less than 50% of list price I thought they were good enough to have as my extra pair. Now the first thing that people do need to be aware of is that these are asymmetrical, which means one side is longer than the other. This is designed so that the cord can go behind your head. That leads to less pulling on the buds, which leads to less cord noise. All budget earbuds have some level of cord noise, but by wrapping the cord around your ear and behind your head you can minimize it pretty well with these. The second factor is that the fit of the tips will be very important for comfort. These tips are not the highest quality out there, but they will do. Those with smaller ear canals should be able to get by with the smallest included size. But if those are still not small enough for you you probably will have to step up to the Etymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones which also have even smaller ear plugs sold seperately. In that case you are talking about 5 times the price, so that's only for those who really have a hard time getting a good fit or are looking for much higher quality. I burned these in over a few days and overall I am happy with the sound. It's not fantastic, but relative to the price I think the performance is adequate. The main gripe I have is around the durability of the wires which definitely feel very suspect. Unlike most other sennheisers I have purchased these had no case included, so I used the case from my Sennheiser MX55 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Headphones which actually is much better designed for these. Some people don't like the 90 degree plug, but I prefer it. I could tell already though that the plug will not hold up to a lot of use so handle gently. These are a good compromise for the price but should not be your primary set of earbuds unless you are not picky at all. If you need something good to commute with and block out the bus or train noise, this is it. If you need something for very small ear canals or want premium quality sound, you will probably do good to consider some other options. Enjoy.

Header: Awesome Earbuds...for a while..., September 4, 2007
Comment:
My wife got me a pair of these earbuds for Christmas last year and I have to say that I loved them. The sound quality is amazing, they're very comfortable, and they block a lot of noise. The noise blocking, like I said, was very impressive. With my stock earbuds, I was often running my mp3 player at 18-25 volume, depending upon outside noise. With these, I was generally running at 5-8. I'm sure that was better for my ears. So what's with the two star rating? Well, In about 6 months, I went through 4 pairs of these earbuds. They'd work great for about a month and then one of the earbuds would stop producing much sound. I'd have to turn the volume up from 5 to 25 to get anything out of that one earbud and, if I did that, the other one would be so loud that I couldn't use them. They were under manufacturer warranty, so I'd send them back and get a new pair and they'd work great, for about a month. I did this a few times and, like I said, I went through 4 pairs in a span of 6 months. Even though they were still under warranty, I finally got fed up with the process and just tossed 'em out. So, like I said, they were great for a little while. Unfortunately, I didn't have much luck in terms of reliability.

Comment:
I read the previous reviews prior to purchase, so will try not to replow too much of that ground. These buds work well for me, with good sound if you get a decent seal between the silicone rubber adaptor and your ear. After some experimentation, I found the mediums work best for me, and I can wear them for several hours at a time without feeling uncomfortable. One tip: Watching a NASCAR pre-race interview, I noticed Jeff Burton really slobbering up his ear pieces to ease insertion. I found that with just a little moisture applied to the rubber with one's finger, it both goes in more reliably and doesn't give you the "wet willy" feel. Once inserted properly, two things: The bass response is pleasing and the wife can prattle on to her heart's content and I can't hear a word. This with my Creative flash player's volume set at the low end, about 5. You'll still need muffs when working with a router or lawn mower, but the buds do a nice job of isolating a lot of the noise. Don't even think of running a Sonicare with the buds in! Trust me on that one. Yes, the wires are a bit stiff, but they don't tangle. However, as others have noted, even walking in a stiff breeze you can hear the whistle from the wires. I have them tucked under a T-shirt so only a few inches is exposed on each side. Also, I thought I'd prefer the "J" cord, with the right ear wire about double the length of the left, as I wear the player on my left arm. In hind sight, given both the stiffness of the wire and the fact I'm wearing them under the shirt, perhaps that wasn't the best choice as I have a heck of a time keeping the left bud in and the right wire not running wild. Not a major fault, but something to consider. The choice appears to me to come down to these Senns or the Shures. A cousin loves his Shures, and they do come with foam adaptors in addition to the silicone rubber. They are a few bucks more. I'm happy with my selection of the Senns, but can't state for sure if I'd be more or less happy with the Shures.

Header: Nice sound and extra wire length, January 14, 2007
Comment:
As others have said, these earbuds give much higher fidelity sound that the ones that came with my iPod 80gB, and they are not prone to fall out of position in my ears when walking or running. The sound is not as high quality, however, as a good pair of over the ear headphones. Small, medium, and large rubber cones are provided... use the set that fits your ear the best. With a good seal in the ear canal, a lot of external background noise disappears, but you can still hear a car horn or a bicyle ringer on the trail; it doesn't make you deaf to the world. One problem is that when you walk or run on a windy day, it sounds like the wind is whistling through the stays of a ship at sea... very annoying. Also, you have to secure the wire close to your neck by running it under your shirt or by other means; if you have a long length of wire flopping around you will hear a thump each time it bounces around. The wire length of the earbuds that came with the iPod is 45". The CX 300 wire is longer, so that I, at 6 feet height and relatively long torso, can keep the iPod in my pants pocket, or even in the thigh pocket on my cargo pants. The cord length is asymetrical so that the length to the left earbud is 53 inches, and 60 inches to the right. This design presumes your iPod is in a left pocket. The extra length allows the right earbud to run behind your head to the ear without putting a strain on the cord... it seems stupid, but actually it works well.

Header: A high quality alternative to Sony, June 22, 2006
Comment:
I ordered these CX300s after my second pair of Sonys died. I loved the fit of the EX51 and EX71 Sonys and put up with their adequate sound for the isolation and comfort they offer. What I couldn't put up with any more is their fragility. I received maybe 1 year's service out of 2 pair of Sony phones and I refused to give them any more of my money. When I saw these Sennheisers with a similar design as the Sonys I was excited as I have two other sets of Sennheiser (over the ear) phones which are excellent. Well, I'm not disapointed. These are more accurate and articulate than the Sonys and have much better bass without getting muddy. They fit as well as the Sonys and have a symmetrical cord*, which I prefer and believe will improve their durability as compared to the Sonys which always fail on the left (short cord) side. I can't speak to the durability of these phones as I've had them only a few days but they COULD NOT be worse than Sonys that are certain to fail quickly. I've seen a few posts that criticize these phones for their poor bass response. I suspect these people have not tried fitting the different rubber gaskets to attain a proper fit. I did this and the sound quality difference is amazing. These phones also seem more efficient than the Sonys as they are louder at a lower setting. My point of reference here has (obviously) been the Sony EX51s and EX71s as they are of similar (in ear) design that I find very welcome when out on the street for their abilty to isolate one from ambient noise. These are not IMO, replacements for a good set of over the ear phones when in a quiet environment. That's not a knock on these specific phones as I don't believe any "in ear" design can compare with good over the ear phones. Highly recommended! Update: subsequent to my writing this I've come to learn that I purchased (through an Amazon associate vendor) the generic version of these earphones. They have the same drivers and gaskets, but a different cord* and no Sennheiser logo. After this was thoroughly explained to me, I'm fine with it as this version of "Sennheiser CX300Bs" have a Y cord and not the asymmetrical cord which so many of us have come to dislike.

Header: Great earbuds for the price, May 20, 2009
Comment:
I collect headphones, and am finally getting around to writing a review for some of them on Amazon. I devised a way to test them, using six songs from a range of genres, and a 1 - 10 rating scale for each element I reviewed. The songs I chose were "The Chain" by Fleetwood Mac, "Every Planet We Reach Is Dead" by Gorillaz, "Concerto No. 26 in D Major" by Handel, "I Know You Are, But What Am I?" by Mogwai, "Afro Blue" by Triplexity, and "The Patient" by Tool. Each song was encoded in 192 kbps or higher Ogg Vorbis and played from an iAudio 7 with all sound effects switched off and the equalizer set to flat. Now to my review... Sound Quality(7.2/10) The Chain(7.5/10) - moderately exaggerated bass, but pleasant treble and mid tones. Fairly crisp and smooth. Good instrument separation. Relatively shallow sound stage. Every Planet(8/10) - nice, clean, punchy bass, with smooth mid tones. Highs are a little bright. Lacking in sound stage. Concerto(7.5/10) - crisp and smooth mid tones and treble. Instrument separation is decent, but sound stage is very small. I Know You Are(7/10) - clean, deep bass, pleasant highs, good instrument separation, but narrow sound stage and mediocre mid tones. Slight distortion at times. The Patient(6/10) - clean but exaggerated bass. Instrument separation decent, but not overly great. Treble is also a bit bright, and sound stage is lacking. Mid tones, however, were smooth and pleasing. Afro Blue(7/10) - tiny sound stage. But deep, clean bass, smooth highs, and vibrant mid tones. Instrument separation is not excellent, but fair. Overall Sound(7.2/10) - sound quality on these is solid and above average. The bass is moderately exaggerated, but actually quite clean, despite the exaggeration. Distortion is fairly minimal. The treble is also slightly bright, but not so much that it causes listening fatigue. Mid tones are smooth and vibrant, but bass is where these shine- it is somewhat exaggerated, but otherwise clean and pleasant to listen to. Their largest weaknesses was sound stage, which was very two-dimensional. Instrument separation is decent, especially for this price range, but don't expect wonders. Good for listening to most musical genres except heavier variations of rock, like progressive metal. Design(8/10) These are a cross between earbuds and canalphones, and thus are ultra small and mobile. You can easily stuff them in your pocket along with your PMP and carry them wherever you go. The cord is designed to hang around the back of your neck so that it stays out of the way. The styling is simple, with sort of an understated elegance to it. They are very comfortable, and can easily be warn for hours on end. They also seem fairly durable - as previously indicated, I stuff them in my pocket on the go, and they still function perfectly after having them for almost six months. Noise Isolation(7/10) While these don't cancel noise actively, they have a fairly large amount of noise isolation due to the in-ear design. Excellent for blocking ambient, background noise, but I doubt they would be particularly effective at alleviating noise from a jet engine. The noise they leak is minimal, so you won't have to worry about annoying the people around you when using these. Bottom Line(7.3/10) I feel these are a good value for the price. Maybe not the best sounding earbuds in this price range, but they still sound good; the best I've personally heard for the money. They're comfortable, durable, and highly mobile. However, opinions on headphones vary wildly according to personal taste, and I always recommend listening to many different pairs before buying(although this isn't always possible with earbuds).

Header: V-Moda who? Or, how to step up from the Sony MDR-EX71/81., July 10, 2007
Comment:
With a range of iPods and MP3 phones, I've mainly used Sony MDR-EX71 and -EX81, and most recently, V-Moda Vibe. EX71s are very comfortable and excel at sound isolation. They also offer acceptable sound quality, but with overly "boomy" bass and almost shrill treble. EX81s maintain the 71s' strong points while improving on the 71s' bass and treble, but only slightly. Furthermore, the over-the-ear hook design is somewhat difficult (especially with sun/glasses). The Vibes offered nearly as much comfort as the EX71s together with excellent aesthetics, materials, and construction. But they lack thorough sound isolation, and even after 4 weeks' use, continued to attenuate the lowest bass and highest treble notes. Which led me to the CX300-Bs. Only 1 day of use so far, and they already have 99% of the EX71s' comfort, 100% of the EX71s' sound isolation, and 110% of the EX81s' sound quality. Which is to say, all notes sound tight and accurate: lows and highs are just slightly nuanced (so you know they're there, unlike V-Moda), while mids are slightly distant but otherwise loud'n'clear. I expect all of this to improve with more break-in. Sennheiser lost 1 star for two reasons. First, the packaging is insanely impossible to open - I nearly lost the different sizes of included eartips trying to open these. And, they lack any form of carrying case, which Sony provides with headphones costing half as much.

Header: Great headphones with some tweaking, October 22, 2006
Comment:
The two minor problems with these inner-ear monitors is the noise of the cord and the shape of the cord. Each issue is easily fixed: 1. The simplest way to fix the cord noise is to put a cheap cord clip (like from a cell phone headset) on the cord and attach it to the left shoulder. This seems to ground the cord and reduces noise to a minimum even when running. 2. The shape of the cord is not so strange when used correctly. Just by chance I put in the left plug and wrapped the right around the back of my neck and put the right plug in my ear from behind. Not only did this reduce noise from the cord swaying, it also made it very convenient when you take the plugs out when you need to hear outside noise. The phones, the left hanging on your left shoulder and the right hanging around the back of the neck and down the right shoulder, rest comfortably and make it convenient to grab and replace in the ear. Honestly, I believe these are the best iem for the money. I have tried the shure e3c, e2, sony 51, 71, koss buds, apple in-ear and standard, and several others. As for fit, ease of placement, listening longevity, sound, and price, these are the best for me. I am thoroughly impressed and the Senn cx300's are my new EDC phones. B

Comment:
I was a big fan of Sennheiser having owned and loved the HD-600 headphones for years. These, however, do not sound noticeably different than the stock iPod headphones and have one fatal flaw, the cord is a hard plastic and any physical contact with the cord transmits a sound straight to the ear. I am using them right now as I type this review. Just moving my head slightly creates a loud rustling sound in my ear. I am ordering a pair of Shure EC2s right now, maybe I'll have better luck with those. Bad.

Header: Excelent music device, May 26, 2006
Comment:
This is my first experience with the IEM technology. I got them to replace the "earbuds" that came with my IAudio G3 which I found to be very unconfortable and actually very painful to wear. After quite a bit of research on various headphone forums and of music hardware reviews I decided to take a chance on the Senn CX300's. I have had them for a few weeks now and they are the greatest little devices since flash MP3 players themselves. Through my research I discovered that the ear tips were interchangeable with IEMs from other manufacturers such as Sony, Shure, and Ultimate Ears (ear tips are sold separately by various vendors including the just mentioned manufacturers). Although they sound and fit great right out of the box, experimentation with different ear tips will provide you with the ideal fit, comfort, and sound response -- since everyone has unique ear shapes, sensitivity, and tastes for sound frequency response. I think they fit and sound best for me with shapable foam tips although I'm still experimenting with various tips. Some people complain that the CX300's have too much bass or not enough bass ... I have learned that all IEMs require you take the time to fit them into your ear canal just right in order to get the frequency response that these devices are capable of. Another often cited complaint is the "J" style cord ... the left side is half as short as the right before they merge together. I think the purpose of this style is to wear the cord behind your ears and around the back of your neck in order to minimize the "stethoscope" noise characteristic of all IEMs where the cord may rub against your clothes and tranfer a low rumble noise to your ears. I have not found this to be a big problem fo me unless there is a silent pause from my IEMs while I'm also moving around a lot. I have read that some are able to further minimize this rumble by using a clip like those used for IEM/microphones that come with cell phones. The price appears to vary here on Amazon anywhere from just under $40 to just under $60 ... so make your purchase accordingly. Regardless, I would value them over $80 since they provided me with exactly what I was looking for. They are very light weight and compact, they are very comfortable, they do a good job of isolating outside noise from getting in and an even better job of keeping music from leaking out, and they sound awsome, -- which works great for my bus commute to and from the office. From what I have read on various forums, there is a significant diminishing return when purchasing more expensive IEMs and have read posts from people that have made actual comparisons that the CX300's have a surperior sound response to the more expensive Shure E2c and the Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 3 IEMs. I would highly recomend the CX300 IEMs. Just make sure to take the time to fit them correctly into your ears before making a final evaluation.

Header: Compared to the Etymotic Research ER-4Ps..., July 27, 2006
Comment:
I've had Etymotic Research's ER-4Ps for about five years now, and absolutely love love love them. Terrific product. I sent them out to www.fixup.net (back when that site did this swap) to swap out the cable to something not as bad microphonically, and after that the ER-4Ps haven't gone more than three or four days without use in the course of those five years. Well, excepting once. When the right transducer experienced a fatigue failure while in my ear canal. Was rather embarassing for me to ask my then-girlfriend to take a set of tweezers and remove the darn thing, but she did a fine job. And despite the fact that they were about six months out of warranty, the Etymotic folks did a better-than-fine job of replacing/repairing (I couldn't tell which) the broken unit for only the price of shipping. And that excellent service included direct email communication with the technician who actually carried out the servicing. Top-notch service, and enough to make me a vocal Etymotic supporter. However, now the left-bud is exhibiting some very serious attenuation, and I can see another mailing off to Illinois is in order. But based on my last experience, I can't live without having something in the interim, and so a quick Amazon Prime-prompted purchase of the CX 300Bs was in order. While I only expected them to carry me through a brief black-out period while my ER-4Ps are being serviced, I have the feeling that they're going to be seeing some fairly regular usage. Believe me, no one is more surprised by that than me. The ER-4Ps have top-notch sound. But where they lack is in the convenience factor. I use the foam ear-tips (that expand in the ear-canal) which are somewhat of a PITA to put in and take out. The Sennheiser buds, on the other hand, go in and out with the greatest of ease. If I'm in an environment where I may need to pause the music, the CX 300Bs are going to be my first choice. Where the ER-4Ps still excel are environments where outside noise is an issue (think air travel), or where cable microphonics may be an issue (exercising). The CX 300Bs are the choice if I'm to be resting in bed (P. Kowalsky's wiki article at the bottom of the page is spot-on), if they may have to go in-and-out of the ears with any regularity (I'm listening at home with my wife and/or daughter around, or I'm at work), or if I need to be cognizant of say the telephone (work, again). Clearly the ER-4Ps provide a truer response than the CX 300Bs, but the CX 300Bs do not make me cringe or otherwise distort the output to any bothersome degree. Honestly, depending on the music you're listening to, the low-frequency boost may be a welcome change after listening to the flat response of a more precision transducer. An unqualified recommendation for the CX 300Bs. And FWIW I do not give out unqualified recommendations for those (I always have to warn potential buyers of the PITA involved with fitting them in your ears, and basically shutting off your sense of sound to the world around you once they're in).

Header: Fantastic headphones at this price!!!!, May 13, 2006
Comment:
Do not believe the negative reviews. The only way these buds don't deliver great sound is if you do not know how to put them on. You have to achieve a sealing effect to get the bass, but once you get them on correctly...wow! I guess it is possible that people have weird ears in which these buds won't fit...but it comes with three sizes that should work for 99% of the population. For the price, these things deliver sound like you spent $100. Great bargain! The sound is clear, and the bass is strong, but not overbearing. Overall very pleasant sound to these headphones. At first I was not a big fan of the asymetrical cord until I realized the right cord is made to go around the back of your head. Now I am a fan because you do not have to go traveling about with a big cord dangling in front of you. The wrap around the back of your head cord stays out of your way. The cord is microphonic, meaning that you can hear when something rubs up against the cord. This is just something that happens with virtually all ear canal headphones. With that being said, the microphonic effect on this set is minimal. Again, fantastic quality and sound for the price! The negative reviews are from folks that don't know how to put them on, or have weird shaped ears that don't accomodate in ear phones.

Comment:
As a commuter I needed a set of good noise canceling earbuds (cover subway sounds). The CX300-B are above average at canceling noise, but unfortunately they create noise whenever the cord touches anything. I'm not sure how anyone could rate them high, as the cord noise is ridiculous and irritating. I found the Klipsch Image S4 to be a superb set, with great noise canceling, and high audio quality. Spend the extra money to get a quality product the first time around, so you don't end up wasting money on the CX300-B.

Comment:
The sound quality is good, the external noise blocking is good, fit is decent, but durability is non-existent. After using these all of about 15 times or so, I noticed the sound had become muffled and weak in one of the earbuds. I sent them back to Sennheiser and they sent me a brand new pair under warranty no questions asked (thumbs up on their customer service). I took extra care with the replacement and handled them as delicately as possible, taking care to never pull on the wires, or bang them around or subject them to any other abuse. However, after a month of so of use, same problem as the first pair. Sound is dead in one earbud and muffled in the other. Stay away from these headphones. They sound good at first, but fall apart fairly quickly even when treated gingerly. This is a disposable product.

Header: Disappointed with CX-300, August 7, 2007
Comment:
I researched these thoroughly before I bought them. I have other Sennheiser products that I really like. I read that other users have had some problems and complaints mostly with the quality and others with the cord noise. I am very careful with my stuff and with my previous experience with Sennheiser, I really didn't think quality was going to be an issue and it hasn't been so far. So I thought OK, how bad can the cord noise be?? Well, its BAD. Extremely annoying to me. Right out of the box, its the first thing you notice. Even if you wear the J-cord the way its supposed to be worn, the cord rubs against your collar and front of your shirt, and makes a pronounced deep rubbing noise. You hear it over the music (even if turned up) and it is quite distracting. It seems to be more when it rubs fabric than skin. On skin the noise is not quite as bad. The only time you won't get any noise is if you stay perfectly still while wearing these, which is very unrealistic. And I don't mean jogging or exercising, I'm talking about just bobbing your head to the music or looking down at your iPod or cell phone. When the cord moves at all, you hear it. So cord noise IS that BAD and it was a big strike one against these buds. However, the sound is really pretty good, especially the bass on most on most types of music. I am certain I have inserted them correctly and got a good tight seal. The bass is as advertised, really, really good. By the way, a note to other reviewers, low frequency is called "BASS" not "BASE". Anyway, lows are good and surprisingly the highs are also very good. The bass is clean and does not overshadow the highs in most cases. They sound "Bright" so to speak. BUT what I noticed is that mid-range is not as good. If you listen to Jazz vocals or pop vocal(say Diana Krall or Kelly Clarkson) for example, you have to change the EQ on your iPod to pump up the treble and kill some of the bass to really be able to hear her voice. Of course, you can't listen to it that way for long, that just kills your ears and really it sounds somewhat artificial. Mid range is just dark and muddy. On jazz and pop vocals the bass on these babies tends to become way too pronounced and kills what little mids there are. It really shows up the weakness in these buds. I noticed one reader said that "CX-300 tends to have problems with music where there is alot going on", classic rock for example. I also found that to be true. But as you can imagine with the clean bass and bright highs, electronic and house music sounds outstanding!! Smooth jazz is quite passable as is hip-hop and R&B. If those are the only types of music you listen to AND you also happen to be confined to a wheel chair or a neck brace and can't move too much then these would definitely be the buds for you! I really wanted to like these and I got what I considered a good deal - 59.99 at Circuit City. I avoided Amazon for these since I saw that many readers had gotten poor quality or even knock offs from some sellers. I wanted to be absolutely sure of what I was getting and was willing to pay a little more for the peace of mind and no hassle return if needed. Overall, I am very disappointed. I am taking them back. More because of the cord noise than anything else. I think for the money I paid, the sound is about right. If the cord noise were not so pronounced, I could definitely live with them for $59 even with the weak mids. Hey, I know these aren't high end audiophile buds and I'm not an audiophile. But I know what sounds good to me. Maybe the next version from Sennheiser will address the cord noise and if so, then I would recommend these for the price. But I cannot recommend, not as they are today. Anyway, I have been looking into the E2Cs. I haven't seen anything about cord noise on those. Some readers say the noise is just worse on the Senns. The reviews on the E2Cs indicate that the mid range is more clear on those. They would likely be a better match for me and my music & ears. Will probably spring for the E2Cs and give them a try when I have the opportunity or can catch them on sale.

Comment:
I've just bought the headphones and as many here, have had high expectations. Well, what can I say - first of all you do have to insert them deep inside your ear canal as was mentioned in several reviews - otherwise you don't have any bass at all. Like NO BASS. But the moment you insert them deep in your ear - yes, the negative reviews state it absolutely honest and clear - your every motion transmits the sound of the wires scratching right into your ear amplified... I can't say it's a _very_ big issue, but it's an issue nevertheless. It is very audible. But even if you've done everything right - and are not moving... Well, I'd say the bass is still a bit too thin. The sound of the phones is not cheap. It is ok... But street-styled PMX60 are better, imho. And cheaper, by the way. Overall... I got the phones for less than 30$ and I'm satisfied. But I would not buy them for more. And I'm not sure, if I'd buy them for 30$ if I knew everything before.

Comment:
This product is incredibly poorly designed. Like many, I use these earphones to listen to music while working out. The cord design is so poor that you hear incredibly loud and annoying sounds every time the cord brushes against you. I've never had this problem with other earphones, and it's so annoying that I'd be much better off listening to the much cheaper earphones that came with my MP3. I really regret wasting my $ on this product and strongly advise against buying it. I can't believe Sennheiser engineering is this bad!

Header: Be sure to avoid unauthorized Sennheiser sellers - their stuff is fake!, October 14, 2010
Comment:
Sennheiser headphones are great. Unfortunately, many of the folks selling on Amazon.com are explicitly unauthorized Sennheiser sellers, meaning they're selling headphones that are counterfeit, defective, or have other problems. I noticed this when I purchased headphones from an unauthorized Sennheiser seller (Closeout Master) which then died within 4 months, even though my previous ones lasted 5 years. When I sent them to Sennheiser for warranty replacement, they called me and told me they were counterfeits and to check their website ([...]) and to not buy from any of the listed companies. The agent explained this wasn't them trying to keep their prices up or the like, but to just avoid places that sold knockoffs. I'm going to contact the seller and ask for a refund, although I doubt I'll get one.

Comment:
The only thing I hate in a set of headphones is when they are designed with the right ear plug being the main (long) wire and the left ear plug is a shorter wire that comes out from the main right wire. This is a design feature that is so incredibly uncomfortable to me that I had to throw these right into the junk drawer. I wish the manufacturer would have stated this. What a waste of money.

Comment:
I was extremely excited to try the Sennheiser CX300-B headphones because of all the amazing reviews that they get. Consumer Reports, Amazon.com, and other electronics websites all praise these headphones highly, so I decided to buy a pair to use with my iPhone. When I first bought them I compared them to the original apple ear buds and a pair of JVC buds that I had. The sound quality for the Sennheiser was indeed much crisper and less muffled than with the other buds although I didn't get as much Bass and I don't know why all thearketing about bass response, I think the apple buds provide much more bass. The biggest problem with the CX300-B is the cord. A lot of other reviews agree but I didn't understand the extent of the problem. Because the iPhone (and iPod and iPod touch) doesn't have a belt clip I have to put it in my pocket. The CX300-b cord can't reach from my pocket to my ears, and the length from the left bud to the right bud (assymetrical) barely fits around my head. So the cord length is a severe problem. Another issue that I find in a lot of reviews is the cord noise problem. The only time that you will hear a loud audible bass response from te CX300-B is when the cord rubs up against something which it often does because it is trying to stretch to your pocket. I can't use these buds at the gym or even walking because the noise is THAT much of a problem. This is especially concerning because buds are supposed to be portable. So with the cord noise these can't be used with a mobile player, and with the cord length they won't reach your computer or stereo so the CX300-b headphones and just about useless.

Header: Annoying Coworkers have nothing on these headphones, July 28, 2009
Comment:
A little information that will help understand the review. I have a coworker who is the most loud and annoying person that anyone in our office has ever known. That may seem like a stretch, but I can assure you that there is no exaggeration. He laughs a little like Santa Claus, except instead of a jolly Ho Ho Ho we get a mind numbingly dumb Ho Ho Ho from the annoying coworker (from here on known as AC). The Hos from AC each get progressively louder. On to the headphones. These headphones block everything except the loudest of the Hos from AC's laugh when the volume is turned to a normal level. I'm sure they would block out everything if I turned the volume up, but I like my hearing. After one of AC's tirades of idoicy a normal coworker called. I didn't even hear the phone ring, but could see the flashing of the message button. When I answered the phone he asked if I had just heard AC's rant. After my response of "What rant" he asked for the link to these headphones. The headphones fit comfortably in the ear and sound good. Bass may seem low if the ear bud isn't inserted far enough into the ear. The cord is long enough that you should be able to have your mp3 player at your waist, but not any further than that.

Header: Sennheiser cx300 Vs V-Moda Bass Freq Vs Bose In-Ear Buds, May 31, 2009
Comment:
A quick review and comparison for 3 ear buds. The first thing that is the most important factor is price; therefore most of my analysis will be based on a price ratio. Comfort Each of these ear buds were basically the same in terms of comfort, however the Bose ear buds may have a slight advantage in this category due to the uniqueness of its in ear yet out of the ear design. There is a more sound isolation in the Sennheiser and vibe ear buds, and between these two ear buds I give Sennheiser a slight advantage in comfort. Sound Quality All of these ear buds have exponential sound quality and PLEASE get one of these if you're using the ipod ear buds or some other cheap generic buds. You will not regret it! Personally I listen to a lot of bass heavy music such as hip hop. I believe that your satisfaction depends on the type of music you listen to. If you like rap, hip hop, r&b then I would recommend the Vibe Bass Freqs Ear Buds. You will be amazed by the deepness, "thump" of the bass and yet the bass doesn't muffle out the high end. The Bose ear buds may have equal or slightly better deepness but not the same "thump". However I think that these ear buds have bad high ends due to the bass. The Sennheiser is unqiue because it have amazing high ends, and yet almost equal bass of the Vibe Bass Freqs and Bose in ear buds. The Sennheiser is a great mix for people who listen to a wide variety of music. Overall I would recommend them over the others. However, if your looking for the best ear buds for bass (rap, hip hop) then go with the Vibe Bass Freqs. Now looking in terms of price, the Vibes and the Sennheiser are basically the same in price about $25. If your on a budget, then the Vibes are a little cheaper (see Durability) and is the best value for the dollar (barely). The worst is definitely the Bose, even though Bose is great company and brand name, they are way over priced for the given sound quality. If you're highly considering Bose, just give Sennheiser a try first. Durability The best durability is from Sennheiser, and the worst is from Vibe Base ( I went through 2 before I bought Sennheiser). Bose is in the middle (mine broke after a year). Bose's ear buds will always pop off and you will probably lose them. The same can go with Vibe, Sennheiser doesn't have that problem. Overall 1.Sennheiser cx300 ( great blend of high and low ends) 2.Vibe Freq Bass ( very close to #1 due to the better bass) 3.Bose in ear (too expensive for same sound quality and bad high ends) Also, Sennheiser has great bass, not at the same level as the Vibe.

Header: Disappointing sound quality, January 6, 2009
Comment:
After reading some reviews, I was excited to purchase these headphones because they sounded like a reasonable bargain. Unfortunately, they've proven to be quite disappointing. The build quality is alright: the wire is light and soft and the drivers are soft too though I really can't get them to stay far enough into my ear to isolate and deliver the most sound they have to offer. Also, the wire is a bit too short for me: I can't put my player in my pocket and have the earbuds remain in my ears because there isn't enough chord and the earbuds get pulled out of my ears as soon as I move (I'm 6'2" and this is a pretty common problem with earbuds for me.) The big disappointment was the sound quality. Bass was almost completely absent; there was only a tiny bit of impact but even that was minimal and the driver had to be quite far into the ear to hear it. I don't expect much from earbuds, given how small the drivers in them are, but these are far and away the least responsive on the low end that I've heard in quite some time. There's plenty of clear high and mid range sound there but it just didn't sound balanced at all to me and the highs sounded a bit more synthetic than say, the standard Apple iPod headphones. I couldn't spend any significant time listening to the headphones, despite an effort to listen to them for an hour or two: after that, I was done. Even my fiancee, who is typically pretty easy to satisfy with headphones, refuses to use them.

Header: Great sound, but not so great for running, January 19, 2007
Comment:
These sound fantastic, and aurally speaking, they are worth every penny. In fact, they are pretty cheap considering the responsiveness and richness of the sound that they reproduce. My only complaint would be that they tend to fall out slightly when I run, which then allows a small bit of sweat to run into the ear canal, keeping the seal from remaining tight. It's a small gripe, but I run a lot (and I sweat a lot, compared to most folks) so I encounter this issue frequently. I would give these 5 stars if not for this small issue. If you don't run or workout with these, they are just about impossible to beat, considering the price. These far out-perform my Sennheiser MX500s, and in my opinion, the Sony Fontopias. I also preferred these over the Shure and Etymotic brands since those both have a pretty large footprint -- their size makes it even harder to run or workout without them slipping. I also can't detect much, if any, difference in sound quality between these and the higher priced versions. I highly recommend them!

Comment:
First, kudos to Sennheiser for customer service. After a month or two, the left side lost its treble component. I contacted the company via their website, shipped the defective pair back, and had a replacement within a about ten days. No hassles, nice! The thing to keep in mind with these phones is that they have *too much* fidelity. They aren't kidding about being "bass driven". With normal use they gave me a headache. Once I figured out that I could set my iPod EQ to "bass reducer" things have been better. The only downside is I can't use them with a Shuffle, which doesn't have any EQ settings. The second thing to note is that sound quality is enhanced across the spectrum. There is no question I can hear mid-tone and treble highlights that aren't obvious with my other headphones (Sony EX71s, which are quite good in their own right). So in summary, these are great headphones for the price. But most listeners will want to tone down the bass a bit. For casual listening (esp. from an iPod Shuffle) the Sony offering is a better choice IMO. I will reserve the CX300s for serious listening and use the Sony's in the gym, etc. RR

Comment:
To begin, the sound on these headphones is definitely high quality. I could hear sounds and lyrics in songs that before were not very clear, which was great! I will not knock these headphones on sound quality in any way, and they fit great in my ears as well. However, I do have several qualms with these headphones. First, the cord is just poorly designed in my opinion. I did not realize it was the type with the shorter end (left ear is about 6 inches, right ear is about 2 feet), which REALLY annoys me. Secondly, the cord picks up sounds like you wouldn't believe - if it even grazes my shirt or touches an object I'm next to it creates an extremely loud noise. Don't even think about trying to run or be active with these headphones. Finally, the cord tangles worse than anything I've ever seen. Everytime I want to use them I spend 2-3 minutes just trying to untangle them. Besides that, though, good headphones.

For the background, I've owned & used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75. Here's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week: Pros: 1. Very good bass & well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.) Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.) 2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.) 3. Very light weight 4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included) 5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &iM716 have better isolation) 6. Moderately priced ($50) Cons: 1. Cables are thin so handle with care. 2. Some people may not like the "phonendoscope effect" (cables frictions.) This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others. 3. No pouch or case PS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80's experience :)

Comment:
I have had the Sennheiser CX 300Bs for about three weeks now. I am very satisfied with this product. I use them for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the afternoon 5 days a week on my public transportation commute. I listen to everything from Sinatra to Zeppelin to RUSH to Crystal Method to Count Basie. The best way I can describe the highs and mids is that it is pretty much a flat response (A representation of what the engineer wanted you to hear when mixing the song. No EQ needed). The highs are clear, but not brittle or crackly. The midrange sounds full and clear as well. I was blown away by the bass response and actually felt a little confused by not being able to feel the physical vibrations from a sub (not really, but you get where I am coming from). With these buds in and with the music even at a lower level it is almost impossible to hear any outside noise that is at a normal level. These are perfect for travel, but probably not the best things to wear while walking through the wrong section of town at night due to the fact they block out the outside world so well. They fit great and don't pull out of your ear when you turn your head. The right bud's cord is a little bit longer enabling you to run it behind your neck which works very well. It seems that all earbuds are designed like this today. The cord is long enough to attach to your playback device and walk with your hand by your side with slack left over. The only drawback to these, if there was going to be one, would be that they did not come with a travel case. Even cheaper earbuds have a case included to protect them while not in use. I am not sure why Sennheiser felt they did not need to include a case with their 50+ dollar earbuds, but they didn't. Other than that I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone that is looking for a great sounding, quality in-ear monitor.

Header: Best compact choice for an iPod, May 12, 2007
Comment:
I've tried out a number of noise-cancelling and isolating headphones with an iPod. Here are my impressions: Shure E4c (isolating): the most accurate and open I know of. With high-quality source electtronics and material, these (or the E5c's) would be the pick of the lot. Unfortunately, they're too revealing for listening to compressed source material through the mediocre electronics of an iPod and very quickly become very fatiguing in that context. Their other disadvantage is obvious: they're quite expensive. Sennheiser PXC 300 (noise-cancelling): these are my favorites. Very accurate without being too unforgiving for an iPod. Their disadvantages: comparatively bulky & won't play as loudly as any of the others mentioned here. Sennheiser CX300-B (isolating): considerably more compact and somewhat less expensive than the PXC 300, these are also quite good. Bass can be very tubby (that might be improved by stiffer custom inserts, but that would more than double the price) Koss "The Plug" (isolating): laughably innacurate. Buy these only if you have tin ears and a habit of losing small things on airplanes. Otherwise do yourself a favor and invest a bit more in one of the alternatives.

Prior to this purchase, I bought many disappointing earbug type headphones from Sony, J-Buds (returned twice) and Phillips. None lasted having suffered from wire damage due to my activities and the non-stop use of my mp3 player. The Phillips lasted the longest, but still none of the aforementioned brands lasted long at all. I've been eyeing Sennheiser because of the reputation for good sound. I decided to try the CX-300-B earbuds in Dec. of 2008; the price was decent and somewhat decent reviews. Well, it's nearly 9 months later and they are still going strong despite abuse--serious abuse--tugging on the buds, stepping on wires, catching wires in hair, drawers, doors, etc. No other brand lasted more than 3 months. Highlights are great sound; very good noise cancelling; quality wiring; angled plug. The sound is high quality (base and treble are tight). Regarding the comment about sound carry when wires are touched--I don't generally have a problem w/ that. It's a hallmark of noise-cancelling buds, so I deal. The buds fit superbly and haven't degraded (torn rubber, loosening fit) like others. I actually dropped a bud in a cup of coffee once. It survived and still sounds great. The wiring and angled plug really seem to help prevent damage. Also, the rubber on the wire has a "sticky" quality--like a high friction material--that seems to prevent the wires from sliding around so much. So, they tend to stay where I put them. All in all, when these buds finally succumb to my abuse, I will re-order a pair of these. Nice going Sennheiser. Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)

i bought these to replace my deteriorating v-moda bass freq's V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black. the cords on the vmodas had started to fray in various places and i was uncomfortable transporting them regularly. my 1st concern with these was whether they were knock-offs. these are the #1 counterfeited earbuds on ebay, but after receiving them, I checked with the authenticity websites and am 90% sure they are legit. sound: highs and mids are excellent, probably the best i've ever had in terms of headphones (my best were some mid-end jvc monitors). bass is lacking and if boosted with eq, can get distorted and muddy. compared to the v-moda's it was pretty obvious that bass was a focus of them and not these. construction feels solid and it seems like they will be more durable than the vmoda's. so, like the review I wrote for the vmoda's, it all depends on what you're listening to. for hiphop & electronica, these are lacking in bass (and i would recommend the vmodas); for rock, pop, jazz etc. - these are noticeably clear, sharp and as accurate as any canal phones i've ever tried. overall, listening to standard pop-alternative, I love these (keane, coldplay, perfect circle, seether)... but trance and hip hop? these leave a lot to be desired (eg: major distortion when listening to method man 'tical') I paid $19.99 on amazon and probably would not pay more than $25. my setup - Creative Zen Vision:M and Ipod Nano 3g.

I can say that I'm not one bit disappointed in having to choose these! These are great earphones for the price and sound quality! Excellent bass and highs/mids are good. Used the default sized ear buds and really did a good job canceling the outside noise as mentioned. The quality build of the earphones feels solid and doesn't seem cheap at all. So, If you are looking for good quality and awesome sound these are for you.

Summary: 8 months of use Everyday user (not a sound engineer or audiophile) Great sound and bass Good noise cancellation Vacuum design with only three different size adaptors Noise during movement Sound at 75% in right ear bud at the 8th month mark Let's be clear, I'm not an audiophile and cannot tell you how good the high, mid, and low ranges are. I'm just your everyday user and I found the sound to be the best I ever heard. The music and sound quality with good quality media was beautiful. Obviously if you are using subpar audio media, you will hear the flaws in the media you did not hear before. The bass was very good compared with your everyday headphones. Also, the noise cancellation is very good for the price. You will not be able to hear someone next to you unless they shout. But that being said there were some overall detractors. The biggest problem many will find is the in-ear design. These are not your typical ear buds that just set in your ear. You are required to pick from the 3 different sizes fits all adapters. Once you have hopefully found the right fit, you place these in your ears and push a little until a vacuum is created between the ear buds and the eardrum. Obviously three sizes will not fit everyone, and it seems you're out of luck if you cannot find a good size. If the size is too small the vacuum will not form and the quality will be bad. And, if the size is too big they will just hurt your ear and pop out a lot. The vacuum feels strange for the first couple of times you use the ear buds, but after a while I got used to feeling and learned to love the sound quality. This design seems fairly common for high quality ear buds, so it seems you will have to get use to it if you want good quality ear buds. Another problem is the cord as many users have brought up. Movement does create sound on the cord. If you tap your fingers along the cord you can hear sound that affects your music, but this is the most extreme case. While running or walking (also when bobbing your head) the ear buds do create a noticeable sound (mostly in the right ear bud) that many perfectionist will find annoying, but for me it was like listening to the sound of your feet hit the cement while running. After a while you get used to the sound since it is always there. Lastly, after using the product for eight months the sound level in right ear bud has dropped to about 75% of the left. I noticed some other people with similar problems. I'm still under warranty and can get them repaired, but with a MSRP of 50$ these should have high quality construction and quality parts. Overall I rated them three stars because with the beautiful sound: you get noise during movement, 3 sizes fits all, and low quality manufacturing. *Please note: I paid 41$ for these on Amazon eight months ago. For 20$ I would rate them 4 stars.

I bought a pair of Shure E2C's to replace a pair of Philips earbuds I'd been using, and I really loved them until I read some reviews and picked up a pair of CX-300's. They make the Shure's sound like a pair of $5 earphones, and they aren't any more expensive. I'd still like to try a pair of Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pros when I've got some money to burn, but I'd venture an opinion that these are the best earphones you can get for less than $100.

Comment:
I got these earphones last year and did not use them for the next 2 months as I preferred over the ear design more than the ear canal design. The primary reason for me getting these was firstly I found these very convenient to carry and to travel with and secondly I was very satisfied with everything I bought from Sennheiser. After using them for sometime I found these to be a Tad uncomfortable and decided to use smaller sized rubber pads (that were included) and whoa the comfort level increased 10 folds. Since these were a better fit the sound quality also increased exponentially. I played around with the sound a bit till I got the perfect level in all ranges and these phones responded. Low range (Bass) is excellent in these headphones, the drivers are tiny but dont let that fool you. I listen to almost all genres of music from Metal to dance and the bass from these was thumping as compared to some of the more expensive over the ear headphones I have used. Mid Range and High Range(Treble, Voice - Vocals usually fall into this range) was pretty good too crisp but not bordering on jarring or distorting. I listen to a few podcasts everyday and found that these earphones performed very well. The voices were very crisp without some of the hiss that accompanies sources. Even when these are not touted as sound cancelling/isolating earphones they do a very decent job of isolating stray sounds around you. I will recommend these headphones over some of the more expensive variety like Shure E2c-n (I have these but after a month the left ear stopped giving me any sound, which was dissapointing as these were the most expensive earphones i ever bought but I cant blame Shure for these this is a problem with all sets). If these break which I believe they will eventually it wont pinch you that hard.

I needed discreet, yet loud, good quality earphones. I bought a pair of JVC earbuds from Best Buy for about $30.00. I was satisfied with those. It's just that over 6 months of missions and the tolls of the Army caused me to lose the rubber piece that went over one of the earphones and I left the additional pieces that came in the packaging in TX; plus the internal copper wiring had started to come threw the external skin. If you can find a pair of the JVC's from Best Buy get them. I loved them. I was thinking that if I spent more money for a high quality brand of ear-buds that the quality would be even better. NOT SO!!! I like these, but don't think that the extra money justified the cost. The only problem that I had with the JVC was that they came only in the color white. (probably trying to compete with IPOD). Someone needs to understand that Soldiers and Marines need a dark color, (black, Beige, Brown) to camouflage the earbuds within our gear. We're not suppose to wear them anyway; but realistically not all situations are of the tactical nature for this rule to be necessary. Trust me if you are in the heat, you're not going to be worried about your earbuds. They both stayed in your ear well and block out noise, even over a loud 5-ton, HUMMV, engine (i'm not a tanker so I don't know about a tank or APC engine). I use them in my ear and put my headphones over my ear buds when on convoy missions and can still hear all of the crew and radio traffic on the mission. The cord lenghth is average with the Sennheiser. The JVC cord length was wonderfully long, but not too long. Neither one has a volume control on the cord, which would be good in my sitting convoy environment; that way I could just adjust the volume on the cord of the earbuds vs. having to take extra time and reach inside my pocket and adjust the volume on the MP3 player. I think I paid $60-$70 for the Sennheiser. Oh, and Amazon won't ship these to an APO address; which sucks, because you have to wait even longer to get from the address you give them in the states and possibly extra shipping expense in my case. I know this will be helpful to some one.

Header: very good earphones, March 8, 2007
Comment:
I read several reviews before buying these earphones. some people saying they are great and others not so great. i think the people having issues with them weren't entirely correct. the design of these earphones are that they are like earplugs and have to seal in the ear. once they are sealed you get the deep bass and great sound. I can get very loud and deep bass out of mine, so much at times i have to turn it down because its overwhelming. i have noticed at times if they aren't making a complete seal it sounds like a cheap pair of earbuds with no bass. a draw back that i have noticed is because they work like earplugs you can hear yourself swallow, chew, drink, etc...plus they tend to build up pressure which can start to hurt. i found that when i put them in my ear if i twist back and forth as i do it relieves the pressure. I also plan to try out the 4 extra size/type rubber ear cushions that were included. also people complaining about static i believe were hearing the cable rubbing against thier cloths. for me they are great because i use them to listen to cds at my desk job. i would not recommend these for someone looking for an earphones for jogging. I will also say that i purchased the OEM non marked version that a certain seller on here offers for less than 1/2 the sennheiser marked and retailed version. they are really the same high quality earphones that sennheiser sells minus the painted on logo. So i can't say if i'd pay full name brand price but for what i paid they were well worth it and i would buy them again if my current ones ever broke.

Header: A High End Audio Lover's Opinion, March 2, 2007
Comment:
As an appriciator of high end sound in general (I own HD 595, PX 100, AKG K26p, and other headphones/earphones including these), I consistently do research and look for new headphones to listen to. I must say that these are quite the earphone value! I find that for around $80 (depending on where it's purchased from), these sound quite good. The highs are a bit laid back and the midrange is pretty good as well. The bass is great depending on which earpieces are used, insertion technique, and type of music being listened to. This creates a fairly clear and powerful sound. The only real complaints that I have are minor issues in my opinion: the asymmetrical cord, they are a bit delicate (so be careful), and they don't come any type of carrying case or pouch. Overall, for the price, these are pretty darn good! If you're looking for some really high end sound, check out the various high end models from: Shure, Etymotic, Ultimate Ears, and even V-Moda; these are all great earphones and far outperform the junk that comes with most CD and Mp3 players!

Header: Perfect pair of headphones...exactly what I wanted., February 5, 2007
Comment:
After several attempts at just buying any ol earbuds...I finally decided to try some that actually worked. The CX300 did the trick. I have tested these on Noisey NYC subways and airplane flights and YES the outside noise is canceled out and I hear the music loud and clear. What a difference. It sounds good and is loud enough on low quality MP3 recordings and DVD's played on a Mac laptops in crowded situations. The earbuds fit comfortably in my ears and don't irritate them like other cheap ones, especially when you loose the foam protectors. There are several different rubber inserts for different ear shapes, but I didn't need any others then the ones that came in the package. The CX300's are expensive, but compared to the BOSE its well worth the money. I had a really hard time finding them in most retail stores in the shopping capital of the world...NYC. I can only assume this is because they are a good product, Sennheiser is most know for making high end proffesional sound gear, so its a name you can trust. I highly recomend this product and I am a working technician in the film and television industry who has used a lot of audio and video gear.

The Sennheiser CX300-B earbuds that I purchased are awesome. I use them with my Microsoft Zune almost every day. I'm not a big audiophile, but I do know how to do thorough research. After concluding on these as being the best for the money I bought them. I am extremely happy with my purchase. These are the 2nd product I have bought from Sennheiser. Highly recommended.

Header: WOW Phones, January 9, 2007
Comment:
I love listening to music and have used many headphones and speakers in the past. When I was buying these, I never tried them before. But, based on reading many reviews online, I decided to take a leap and buy these. I was looking for good canal phones that would do the following: 1) Prevent outside noise from interfering with my listening experience 2) Be comfortable...I repeat...MUST BE COMFORTABLE 3) Must have excellent audio quality I am happy to say that all of the above have been met. These canal phones, when listening to audio, do prevent outside noise from interfering (when I used these on a plane...I couldn't tell that I was in one if not for the turbulance). They are superior in comfort to traditional earbud phones (those that come with the iPod, and most other MP3 players). They come with 3 bud sizes to ensure a good fit. Finally, the quality of these is excellent. I can hear the lowest to the highest notes just great and the bass is excellent and is highly adjustable via your equalizer. If you insert these canalphones in your ear properly such that they create an air-tight seal (canal phones are designed to be used in this way), you will reap the benefits that I have talked about above. So are there any cons? Maybe...the cord length might be an issue for very tall people (but I'm not so tall so it's not an issue for me). Second...these canal phones' wires are the J-shaped kind, in which the right side canal phone wire is longer and meant to go behind the head. I find this design more effecient and convenient as the wires don't get in my way way as compared to regular Y-shaped wires...however...this is a personal preference. All in all, I would recommend this product to anybody who wants great quality headphones that are comfortable and allow you to focus on the audio. The price on these is excellent as well.

Comment:
Terrific set. The cx-300's fit perfectly in my ears, stayed in and were VERY comfortable. The sound is exactly right. I have tried the Shure e2c and the Bose Triport in-ear. Both of these had very good sound. However, the e2c's were a horrible fit. I tried for tree days to find the right combination of foam tips, but finally had to give up. They kept popping out of my ears. Wearing them gave me a headache. Very frustrating! The Bose sounded very good, but the CX-300's seem to have a better fit.

Header: Clear sound, great fit, but "noisy" wires, October 5, 2006
Comment:
All comments regarding contact between the wire and clothing will be transmitted and clearly heard are all true! I noticed this immediately. I then tried 2 other pairs of ear buds I have, one which comes with my MP3 player, and another $20 pair from Philips. Neither of these transmitted as much "brushing" noise as the CX300. Something about the CX300 wire that aggravates the noise transmission. If you sit still and have the ear buds inserted in adequately deep (with the best-fit of the 3 pairs of buds), then the music is very nice. Clear and crisp sound at all ranges. I also find that the bass can be a little underwhelming. However, I tried different equalizer presets (Rock, Jazz, Classical, etc.) on my MP3 until I find the one which yields the most pleasant bass. Still not too impressed with the bass production. The best thing I like about these ear buds is the fit. I chose the smallest buds, and they fit extremely comfortable, more than any other ear buds I've tried. The comfortable fit and clear sound alone are worth the price paid. But Sennheiser should improve the CX300 by reducing/eliminating the wire noise and increase the bass production.

Comment:
I just received this product today and was very disappointed when I connected them to my iPod and listened for the first time. I thought where the heck is all the sound and then figured I was misled. The size of the buds are much smaller than the photo suggests so I figured the sound matches the size. No base no mid tones and all treble. Then I pushed them down further into my ear canal and WOW, I felt like I was in some European amphitheatre. The music came to life. It produced deep bellowing base and sharp treble and mid tones. Honestly I was almost blown over with the richness and beautifully balanced sound. I listen to a lot of classical music and these ear buds brought the symphony to my home. You could hear every nuance from the highs of the violin to the deep rich sounds of the bases and cellos. I cannot tell you how pleased I am with these headphones, it's the best money I have ever spent on my iPod as it makes the world of music come alive and in vivid color. If I had known ho wonderful this product was before I purchased them I would have paid double the price.

Header: The positives far outweigh the few negatives, April 25, 2006
Comment:
First off, these buds sound great, orders of magnatude better than the ipod earbuds. I'm not an audiophile but I know what I like, and these sound great. On top of that they are very comfortable. They come with three interchangeable earcups or whatever they're called, at first I thought I could get by with the medium size but quickly had to upsize when they kept falling out. The cups also give you a great deal of sound isolation. I like to go outside on my lunch breaks and take a walk around downtown Madison, with these buds in, and the music not even halfway up, I can barely hear anything else. Even construction sites, though not silenced, are greatly muffled and much more comfortable to walk past, something I would have paid $50 for alone. However. There are two minor downsides I found that keep this score from perfection. First is the cord, it seems sticky, I know that sounds odd, and it's not really tacky or anything but it feels like it sticks to everything, particularly itself. This causes friction which travels up the cord to those nice ear cups I mentioned earlier and translates into rustling noises, I found this only to be a problem only when I wear a jacket, the one day it was nice enough to not wear one I didn't have that problem. The other downside, and perhaps this is just my freakish ears, is the wind. If there is any kind of wind I get a wooshing noise through the cups, perhaps my ear canal is too big even for the large cup, but I have to imagine this happens to others too. It's like listening to a shell on the beach. This causes the largest listening problem for me, the wooshing sound is distracting. Bottom line however, I would recommend and purchase these earbuds again in a heartbeat. For the price you can't beat them. Small lightweight, comfortable and sound great. Honestly if youre going to sit still inside these are perfect for you, or if you do some walking they're still pretty darn good. Buy em you'll like em.

Header: Whew!  Almost shelled out for the Ultimate Ears!!, February 24, 2006
Comment:
I'd been waffling whether to get the Ultimate Ears super.fi 3 Pro's, or the 5 Pro's. I'd listened to a pair of UE 3's a friend of mine had picked up and thought I might like the UE 5's since they supposedly have more extended bass. Luckily, I wavered long enough for these cx300's to come out. Man, am I glad I waited!! I'm not gonna snow you and tell you they'll replace my Senn 595's....but they'll get more than their fair share of usage. I've had these 2 weeks now and I'm continually amazed at the sound. Although, at times I think the bass is just a tad much, the cx300 is smoother across the frequency range than I anticipated. And, they amply block out the server stacks (and the boss!) that I sit next to at work. I whole-heartedly recommend these!

Header: Great earbud for the money., May 23, 2007
Comment:
I just purchased the Sennheiser CX300s (for approx $59) to replace my broken Sennheiser MX550s (paid about $25). I also own a pair of Westone UM2s ($250), Shure E2Cs (paid $40), and Ipod buds (free with promotional Shuffle). I listen to a wide variety of music, usually at volume settings below 7 (out of 28) and often around 2. I love my music, and my hearing. Since I don't have my player "cranked", I can't comment on how the earbuds perform at 100+db. What I want is full bodied sound at low and moderate volume levels. For reference, the Ipod buds are the bottom of the bucket. Low quality, low efficiency, low comfort. Next up from the bottom was the MX550s. My only disappointment in these was the sound quality. Too bad that's their main function. I did like the in-line volume control and the nifty plastic case was nice. They were also comfortable when sleeping. The Shure E2Cs are generally higher priced than the CX300s but have significantly inferior tone quality (mostly lacking low end punch), are larger, and have a thicker and less pliable cord. They do have a variety of "tips" available, most of which have superior sound isolation capability compared to the CX300s. The CX300s are very comfortable but like with all in-ear-monitors (IEMs), the sound quality is dependent upon a good seal in the ear canal. For some, it takes a little practice to properly insert the earbuds. The big secret is that you don't jam them into your ears. When properly inserted, the CX300s produced every bit as much (or more) bass and mid-range response as the dual driver UM2s. While walking on a very windy day, I did notice a significant amount of wind noise transmitted through the CX300s' thin rubber ear-shell. The cord is pliable but due to the connection method at the earbud, a significant amount of cord vibration (rubbing against clothes) is also transmitted into the ear. Once inserted, the CX300s stayed put with very little need of adjustment. So how do they compare overall to the much more expensive UM2s? If sound quality were the only issue, I'd take the CX300s every time. The UM2s like other upper end IEMs have a variety of tips available. If you need extreme sound isolation (with good sound), you'll want the UM2s or equivalent. Although originally developed for musicians for on-stage use, strong isolation earbuds are great for any situation where you'd otherwise be using earplugs. I use mine while running a backpack leaf blower, log splitter, lawn mower, chain saw, and my personal favorite, long airline flights with the screaming baby seating directly behind me. Although the CX300s would be helpful in these situations, their isolation ability is probably about half that of the UM2s. They'd be very good in moderatly noisy environments (bus, busy restaraunt, etc). Their isolation is strong enough that I would not wear them while biking (but walking or jogging might be OK). The UM2s also have the best cord I've ever seen. Extremely pliable and transmits very little cord noise. In general, if you're looking for a great sounding pair of earbuds at a reasonable price, and would like moderate isolation ability, the CX300s should definitely be on your short list.

Header: Great sound, bad cable, flimsy construction., June 10, 2010
Comment:
I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here in pointing out the poor durability of these headphones. When I first received them and tried them out, I was really pleased with the sound. They insulate your ears from outside noise very well and sound terrific. The problem lies with the fact that I've only had them for 3 months and the left headphone has stopped working already. I'm guessing that there's a loose wire inside somewhere and, after just 3 months, I'm must say that I'm disappointed. Even if the wire hadn't come loose and the left earbud stopped working, I most likely still would not have purchased this model again due to the unorthodox asymmetrical design of the headphone cord. Where the main cord splits into the single wires leading to each earbud, the left wire is significantly shorter than the right wire, causing the entire headphone cord to ride down the left side of your body (if you're carrying your music player on your left). This might make sense for some people, but for me it's incredibly annoying as the cable rides directly in front of my shirt pocket and, also, the 'collar' where the 2 single wires join into the cord constantly gets caught on my shirt collar when I turn my head. Why couldn't they have just stuck with a traditional cable? Overall, this is an unfortunate product for Sennheiser, as they have a truly great sounding set of earbuds connected to a truly flawed and unreliable headphone cable setup.

Comment:
Have used earbuds for over 20 years as well as over the ear headphones. That said, I believe anyone thinking the sound quality of an earbud set will equal the OTE set is looking for something non existent or paying a lot of bread for very little gain. These earbuds are fantastic for exercising, traveling on the plane, train, etc and doing odd jobs around the house. My favorite: laying on the beach. You can't take a 500. set of OTE studio sets out to do this..sorry, just not practical. Now for these Sennheisers: Have had UE, Bose, Kliptch, Sony so I can say that these are the "BEST BUY" on the internet bar none. These were the first that were able to really show me the variance of music sounds from my iTouch equalizer for various types of music. Warning: you will have to take off the bass enhance on the iTouch since these kick it into hyper space. I don't know about the newer 300II models but these have all the features you would ever need until they wear out. Just look at how many of these were purchased and reviewed? So, what are you waiting for? Dennis (Newage44)

Header: It's the FIT, stupid!, January 11, 2010
Comment:
Count me a recent convert. I briefly tried these when a friend of mine bought a pair, hated them, had me listen to them in passing, and I agreed. Later on, looking for something cheap but ok-ish for listening at the office, I decided what the hell, and ordered a pair anyway after shopping around. Nothing else in this ballpark of comparable quality it seems. Now that I've had a chance to really play with these, I'm convinced that the people who are complaining about the sound quality of these earbuds simply didn't choose the correct rubber ear pieces. These come with a small, medium, and large --- the mediums are the ones on when you take them out of the box (IF you can take them out of the box---more on that later). I experimented with all 3 and found that the small allowed the buds to fit deeper in my ear and resulted in much deeper bass and a generally richer, fuller listening experience. The medium and esp. the large ear pieces made the sound much thinner and weaker. Now, as for "brightness"---yes I'd concede that these are less than "neutral" audiophile earbuds, but they are not PAINFULLY bright---at least not unless you are blasting your music through them, which is a very bad idea to begin with. (Certainly they are clearly better than cheaper mass market brands in this price range, like Phillips and Sony and Panasonic.) These in-ear designs are great in that you can play music at a much lower volume, sparing your eardrums and avoiding long-term hearing loss...I had my MP3 player at about 40% of the volume level I use when listening to my over-the-ear open-air phones, and due to the exceptional clarity/detail as well as the solid 15db of noise-reduction, still enjoyed it greatly. Very quick, outstanding attack and decay. Yes, the open-air phones are even richer and certainly more balanced tonally, but they are not very useful in an office environment or on a noisy commuter plane/train. I wouldn't pay fifty or sixty bucks for them (MSRP) but for thirty clams, I can live with the subtle flaws. * Now, my biggest gripe: the god-awful PACKAGING...you practically have to use a blowtorch or hacksaw to open the damn plastic box, it seems built to protect a nuclear weapon or something! What is up with that, Sennheiser? ==== UPDATE 1/21/2010 --- after further break-in (left them on for 2 days straight) and using these phones on 4 different sources (my work desktop PC, home laptop, Sony MP3 player, and Cowon MP3 player) I think what has become apparent is that these are highly REVEALING headphones...they don't create their own "sound" as much as they simply communicate the quality of the source player and source material. What this means is that if you play them on a crappy machine (my office PC) they will not sound very good. My Sony has great SQ but is a bit bass-heavy...with the Senns the bass finally becomes just right. Their detail and speed is consistent across the board, though...very dynamic. UPDATE 3/7/2010 --- after buying a NuForce Icon mDAC (external soundcard + headphone amp) I am now 100% convinced that these earbuds are simply TOO REVEALING of their source material. With the mDAC, even my crappy office computer now puts out amazingly rich and beautiful tunes through these Senns! I plugged my previous el cheapo $6 random-Chinese-made headphones in, and they still sound bad. So once again: garbage in, garbage out---if you have a crappy rig, maybe you should avoid these fine earbuds.

Header: pretty nice earbuds, January 4, 2010
Comment:
The Sennheiser cx300 earbuds are a very decent set of headphones well worth the price. The sound quality is pretty decent, and the bass will definitely satisfy you. But lets get a little more specific. I bought these earbuds right before my summer vacation, and since it involved a lot of traveling i wanted some small and portable headphones that wouldn't cost too much. My Sennheiser HD202s were nice, but really huge and completely impossible to bring anywhere. So I decided on the CX300s, partly because I trusted the brand, and the reviews were good. So I ordered them from Amazon, and two days later they arrived. First impression: they sounded pretty nice! very rich and full, and while a little muffled, the sound quality was enough to make them my primary pair of earbuds. At first the asymmetrical cable was kind of awkward, but now I really like it. It makes it really easy to take them off because they just hang around your neck, and keep the buds from hanging under the weight of the cord. But back to sound quality. After my "burn in" period, Im ready to admit that the sound isn't perfect. It isn't as crisp as it could be, and high "s"s and "t"s are pretty piercing, but i hardly notice that now. The bass is kind of muddy, and mids aren't that pronounced. But overall I like it a lot and and love the strength of the bass. I never new it before, but im really a basshead when it comes down to it. If you are too, you'll love them. but let me clarify. Its not that the bass is particularly creal of consise. Its that its just THERE. Its strong. It fills the whole song. It makes the music feel really warm. Now for the build quality. I think the buds themselves are designed very well, although the silicone tips could be a little more secure (actually I've lost them three or four times. Its a frightening experience). However I have to complain about the cord. Its made out of rubber, rather than plastic, which makes them super liable to vibrations. This means that any rubbing against your clothes or bumping of the wire will be like an earthquake to your ears. Which can get really annoying, although a lot of the time it doesn't really bother me all that much. In fact I didn't notice this until someone who borrowed them pointed it out to me. not a huge issue, but something to be aware of. The seal of the buds in my ears is really good. I can super easily pop them into my ear, no fuss. sometimes the seal isnt quite right, and it will take a couple tries to get it right, but that's rare. The sound isolation is also quite good. Put them on, and you are suddenly in your own world. I can sit 4 feet away from a loud piano and have to pop one bud out to see if its still playing. However, this can be annoying sometimes, as nobody can verbally communicate with you when you wear them, but overall a convenience. I was never very careful with these headphones, letting them sit crammed in my tiny pocket all day, falling asleep wearing them, tossing them around, even letting one but fall into a cup of tea, which is probably why they just broke. Its a problem with the jack, and the right ear conked out last night right after being yanked out of my ipod by a menacing doorknob. It was bound to happen. I dont want to blame Sennheiser for this mishap, and this does not tie into my 4 star rating because there is only so much you can do to buds beofre they break. im actually slightly glad they broke because it gives me an excuse to get new ones. Which is really the bottom line of this review. I like them a lot, but not THAT much. The sound quality is good enough, but the muffly cord and slighly below par clarity were enough to keep me wanting an upgrade (which Is on its way. The Denon c551s). But if you love bass and dont want to spend a fortune on some buds, I highly recommend this pair of headphones. By the way, heres a handy little "pros and cons list" if you dont want to read why whole review. Pros: Good rich sound Great Bass Asymmetrical cable (to some it might be a con though) Cheap Stylish Cons: Cord is super muffly Mids and highs are a little weak-ish (not that I care though. For all i care you can screw mids and highs) They broke after six months Not all that durable They should come in white. Srly. I hope this helps you make your decision. If i had read this review I would know all I know know now about these buds, which I dont regret getting in the least. So enjoy!

Header: Sennheiser CX300's vs. Sony MDR-ED21LP's, May 13, 2009
Comment:
It's not surprising to see the Sennheiser CX300's listed as #1 on Amazon's list of best-selling earbud headphones. The most popular consumer magazine recently rated them above a pair costing ten times as much. But it's somewhat surprising that the Sony MDR-ED21 earbuds aren't listed more prominently among Amazon's best-sellers, since they were also rated above the costly "audiophile" earbuds and are currently selling at a sizable discount even to the CX300's. When my wife borrowed my Sony ED21's and didn't want to give them back, I decided to order the CX300's. While I don't necessarily regret the decision, I do have second thoughts. A few observations: 1. The Sennheisers plug directly into the ear canal; the Sony ED21 design is a "compromise" between the familiar, conventional buds (e.g. Apple's standard issue) that are held in place by the cartilage of the outer ear and plugs that are inserted into the ear canal. The Sony buds enter the canal but only part way, sealing out less sound than the Sennheiser CX300s but compensating for the loss with an ingenious little "sound board" that serves to boost the bass. (Because of this design, it's especially critical with the ED21's not to switch left and right ear-buds.) 2. Bass, or lack of it, is the main issue with any earbuds--the reason that listeners still use full-sized headphones. Both the Sennheiser and Sony buds reproduce the deepest bass frequencies, but both are admittedly quite "anemic" (and I'm someone who's habitually complaining about over-amplified bass). Because they form a tighter seal and are more sensitive (i.e. louder), the Sennheisers have a slight edge in reproducing bass that, though light, is noticeable without the use of equalization, etc. (If you expect to have big bass with a pair of ear buds, best wait: Sony has announced the imminent release of a radically new design. Price? Five hundred smackers.) 3. The CX300X buds have outstanding treble, but compared to the MDR-ED21 buds, the balance in the mid-range lacks richness and warmth to my ears, sounding almost "tinny" upon some quick exchanges between the two devices. I'm afraid the resonant vocal tones of Sinatra or Ann Hampton Calloway are done the greater disservice by the Sennheiser buds. 4. The 3 pairs of covers, or soft adapters, included with the Sennheiser buds have less to do with the size of the listener's ear canal than with his or her preference. All three are likely to "fit," so the question is how deep the listener wishes the bud to penetrate the auditory canal. The largest one is no doubt the "safest," but the smallest one will provide the tightest seal--along with the best bass and smoothest overall sound. (But best decide which of the three you prefer asap. My guess is that misplacing one of these is more a probability than a possibility.) 5. Some Amazon reviewers have criticized Sennheiser's designers for shortening the length of wire (by two-thirds) to the left earpiece. Sennheiser justifies the asymmetrical length with directions that the long wire (to the right ear) is to be worn behind the neck, thus avoiding superfluous wire hanging from the user's chin. I'm OK by that,, but should it be an issue, the Sony buds employ wires that are of equal length--and, moreover, are adjustable. (Just remember that the Sony mini-cans are essentially ineffective if left and right ear buds get switched around; with the Sennheiser's the only effect would be a reversing of channels.) 6. Possible deal-maker/breaker: the CX300's come with a slightly larger housing for the 3.5mm plug, yet turning the plug in my player or jiggling the cord itself transmits static, "microphonics," and other non-musical sounds, sometimes causing a channel to cut out momentarily. I can't reproduce the effect in the Sony ED21's, which appear to be much better insulated. Runners probably should steer clear of the Sennheisers; either that, or take seriously Sennheiser's directions (on their website) to wear the "long wire" behind the neck to reduce flapping of the wires. 7. The Sennheiser buds come with those 4 extra ear covers--that's it; the Sony pair comes with a little cinch carrying bag--that's it. Take your pick. I'm giving the Sony's 5 stars for better durability and insulation, better protection against hearing damage, better price, and at least comparable sound. (Or, purchase both, and use the Sony sack for storing the extra Sennheiser covers.)

Header: line hum ruins otherwise decent performance, March 1, 2009
Comment:
I bought a pair to replace sony ex71's (many years old, and great up until i caught them in the car door). I wanted to like these, but there is an unacceptable level of line "hum" which basically ruins otherwise decent performance. Cords are too thin and "sticky" rubber, which means they tangle very easily. I also worried about counterfeit (bought from J&R via amazon, not amazon) but based on others' descriptions of build quality, etc. I don't think they are fakes.

Header: Great Earbuds at a Great Price, February 5, 2009
Comment:
I'm no audiophile, but I seriously doubt that you'll find better earbuds in this price range. I see that some people have been critical of these when used during exercise/activity. I don't think this type of earbud is intended/marketed for use during exercise/activity, so it's not fair to rate them on that basis, since there are headphones out there that are specifically marketed to the active person. (Note that the asymmetrical cord is meant to go around the back of your neck, rather than the front, so that when you take the earbuds out, they don't fall to the ground.) That said, my husband & I gave each other an iPod Touch 2G for our anniversary. I gave him these earbuds with his iPod. He gave me a pair of Pioneer earbuds. I immediately compared the sound of the Pioneer earbuds to the Sennheisers. No comparison! The Pioneer earbuds were a huge disappointment! I needed to listen to the Pioneers on a louder volume, but they lacked base, and the music was full of static. My husband has some permanent hearing loss, and can't hear some wavelengths, but even he could hear the difference. The Sennheisers have nice base and clarity, although if you're a basehead, I suppose that it's possible to find earbuds with more base. I don't need the base to overwhelm all of my music like a teenager breaking the decibel ordinance driving down the main drag. The Sennheisers provide a richer, deeper, truer sound with nice highs and lows (though, I'm no sound techie). My only concern is that the earbud style (common to any brand of earbud) blocks out ambient sound TOO WELL. I wouldn't want to be wearing these in a public park, on the subway, or walking downtown in a metropolitan area, for example. Being insulated from the sounds around me would make me feel unsafe, not to mention that most of the time, I'm taking care of my 3-year-old, and even if I'm listening to music, I need to be able to hear her in order to keep her safe. I guess that's why they make speakers with iPod docking stations, but those aren't really portable. The sound quality of these are great, but I do wish I could find some good quality, drop-in style earbuds that come in a smaller size to fit my smaller ears, rather than the typical one-size-fits-all drop-ins like the Apple earbuds that come with the iPod, because in many situations, it's good to be able to hear ambient sounds, even while you're listening to music. If you're looking for economically-priced, compact earbuds with great sound, you can't go wrong with these. I immediately replaced my Pioneer earbuds with a pair of these. These would probably be great for watching movies on a portable DVD player during a long flight, too.

Comment:
I LOVE these earbuds. I find that when I wear normal headphones all day (I work in a noisy office with "enthusiastic" coworkers), I get a headache from the pressure of the headphones, so I prefer ear buds. For the price and for the functionality - these earbuds are FANTASTIC! They're perfect for closing out almost all external sounds, they come with different sized covers for the buds so you know they'll fit in your uniquely shaped ear, and I've been using them for over a year now without a single complaint and even after a few "desk accidents" (the random coffee, or peanut butter honey sandwich needing to be washed off). At first, I thought the irregular cords (one side of the cords is longer than another) would bother me, but it hasn't been a big deal. They keep out the external noise (and boy, is there external noise here), they sound GREAT (at all volume levels!) and they are little workhorses. Delicate, unobtrusive and yet really great - I recommend these earbuds to anyone!!

Header: Awesome Earbuds! Highly Recommended!, January 3, 2009
Comment:
First I'd like to state that I'm not a picky listener and I have little experience with music quality and things of that sort; previously I was using a pair of 10 dollar Sony earbuds, and before I broke them(accidently stepped on, lol) the pair that came with my ipod Classic. These are definitely an improvement. They are pretty good at isolating outside noise. It comes with 3 sizes of silicone tips, I have small ears and these fit nicely, so if you're worried about the fit, there is no problems there. A few things to note, they have an asymmetrical cord meaning one cord(the right earbud)is longer than the left; I'm not a big fan of this, it looks semi awkward if you're not wearing them correctly(lol, they have instructions on how to properly wear them inside), plus I tend to rip the left one out occasionally, that being said it's a small subtraction. Anyway for 20 dollars, these are totally worth it, selling for 59.99 at most retail stores. Lastly I wouldn't recommend these for gym use as they do slip out fairly easily; this is due to the fact you have to have this sort of "seal" with the silicone tip and the ear canal, they never really feel secure, as they would with a sports/apple earbud. That being said, these come highly recommended for casual use, such as walking to class, on the bus, sleeping etc. What's in the box? Not much, the 3 sizes of silicone buds and the earbuds themselves, that's about it. Also they have a 2 year warranty for the earbuds, which is nice. Note: Make sure you buy them from an authorized dealer, I bought mine directly from amazon and they are legit; that being said, there are people who apparently are getting fakes from Amazon, so I guess it's hit or miss. You can check if you got fakes fairly easily by checking the physical characteristics, just google fake Sennheiser cx300's, you'll get pictures and what not. Quick Summary Pros: Cheap 19.99 from Amazon Improvement over ipod earbuds and cheaper earbuds Nice outside sound isolation Clear sounding audio Great for casual use Cons: Asymmetrical Cord Not for gym use Easy to get fakes, google this.

I have a very specific need when searching for earbuds. I suffer from tinnitus, and use my mp3 player to provide masking sounds (rain on a roof, say). So I need the buds to 1) be comfortable for long periods. 2) STAY IN! 3)provide at least reasonable fidelity. 4) block outside noise. 5) allow me to sleep with them on, i.e., not feel like a golfball in my ear when I lay on my side. These buds do all that, plus they sound good when I am listening to music. And they were not outrageously expensive either. A good purchase for my needs.

Header: Push way in for best sound, August 8, 2008
Comment:
I like these headphones. First though, beware of fake CX300's out there. It seems that the market is full of Chinese counterfeits of this headphone. Price is probably your first indicator of a fake. If it's selling new for less than $30, it's probably a fake. There are many web sites dedicated to exposing the fakes ones vs. real ones... search the web for "CX300 fake." That said, the pair I bought here from Amazon are the real thing, and they do sound good. You just need to put on the right sized rubber tip on for your ears. I use the medium size. The way to know the right size is to push them into your ear canal until the sound starts to become muted (because it's hitting the end of the canal). Then back it out just a little bit and it should stay in there. That's the position where you get the best bass response. The small size tip kept sliding out and the large one would not go in far enough. One other tip... as of right now, the white and silver colors are about $10-$15 less than the black. Same headphones, different color... save yourself some money and buy the white or silver. Who cares what color they are? That's it. Other than that, I agree with most of the rest of the reviews -- the sound is excellent for the price, they fit inside my motorcycle helmet and stay in my ears. The cord is long enough to have the MP3 player in your pants or jacket pocket. What more do you want?

Header: Good sound, poor durability, July 3, 2008
Comment:
I bought these headphones around a year ago, and have been using them ever since. While I'm fairly impressed with the sound quality, and think the noise isolation is great, the quality of construction is a bit worrisome: The rubber cable covering isn't particularly strong. I got these caught on a door handle as I walked past, and while I should have been more careful, the rubber was easily yanked back, and the cord is only intact with the assistance of electrical tape and superglue. In addition, the earbuds themselves aren't particularly durable. One of the earstems (which I use to twist the earbuds in) came loose, and has since come loose several more times even after I superglued it back. Also, if you can see on the picture, the black part has come apart from the silver part on both sides, exposing the inner workings, and I have had to resort to superglue once again. Finally, the rubber inserts come off very easily. After losing a medium and then losing a large (I switched to the large ones after I lost a medium), I was forced to buy some generic inserts, and they fit even worse! I once again superglued them on, which seems to work well and, surprisingly, doesn't affect the sound quality. I bought these headphones based on glowing sound reviews, and have no complaints in that area. If you are a very gentle user then these would probably work well for you, but if you listen to them while you work out or something, I'd recommend finding some more durable headphones.

Comment:
The bad news: as other reviewers pointed out, if the cords are touched at all -- if they brush against your clothes, or even if they are exposed to wind -- they transmit a tremendous amouth of noise to your ears. I can only use these earbuds if I'm not moving at all. The good news: the sound is good, way better than standard iPod earbuds. And the rubber tips make for a good fit.

Header: Beat the Shure E2C, December 3, 2007
Comment:
I bought these about 5 days after receiving my newly purchased Shure E2C canalphones. Anyone who is considering those as well may want to read my review on the Shure's if you can't decide. The Sennheisers have satisfied me after literally the first 5 minutes of use. The bass that was non-existent in the Shure's is almost all there. I was looking for a replacement for my Sony Fontopia's, which have a good deal of thumping, booming bass. While the Sennheisers are not quite as deep, they still get 5 stars since they sound considerably more "real" in the mid range. At first I thought they sounded clangy but after comparing the Senn's and the Sony's, it turns out the CX300 have the right amout of mid and the others were just too bass-heavy. If you like to listen to popular music with good, thumping bass, the CX300 are an excellent choice. Many people have complained about the cord noise. I have been using canalphones with this "horrible defect" for 2 or 3 years now and trust me you get over it pretty quick. I use canalphones even while jogging and the cord noise does not detract severely from the musical quality. I just see it as the price you pay for the sound isolation you get from the in ear design. What noise you may get from the cord is still insignificant compared to the noise you would be experiencing from the ambient environment. In short, please read my review on the Shure E2C if you want a more detailed comparison. The CX300 have all the positives I noted there (except the behind the ear design) and none of the negatives I commented on. As long as the cord, which seems a bit thin, holds out, I'm shure I will be enjoying these for another 2 years.

Header: Very very impressive, October 27, 2007
Comment:
A friend at work has a set of these, and I was blown away by the comfort and depth of sound. I own a number of other Sennheiser headphones for my home stereo, television, etc., so I was very anxious to get these. I've always been very pleased with the acoustic quality and mechanical construction of Sennheiser products. I bought the least-costly set from a third-party vendor, which turned out to be a mistake. Although the CX300 earphones arrived promptly, the sound was simply awful. The sound was dull; the bass was muddy; and the midrange honked (audiophiles know what I mean here). The quality of construction also seemed to be poor, and the earphones were larger than my colleagues. I contacted Sennheiser almost immediately and sent my earphones to them for inspection. Within a week, I received a new set of CX300 earphones. I noticed that the packaging was markedly different. I didn't receive a diagnosis on the other set. The sound from these was all that I expected and more. You have to pick the correct foam cushion when using them. That makes a big difference in how they sound. The actual earphone is a bit tiny, so I often use my fingertips to gently rotate them in my ear slightly to get them seated correctly. Don't push too hard, because it can create a vacuum, which is uncomfortable, especially when you remove them. As far as sound quality, they are ever-so-slightly bright but not over the top. Bass is deep and reasonably well controlled without becoming tubby -- no small feat considering that these earphones are roughly the size of the tip of your pinkie finger. Midrange seems to be very nice. A true test of a speaker (whether it be a headphone, earphone or big box on the bookshelf) is its ability to reproduce piano and women singing. In both cases, the CX300 performs excellently -- restrained and on target. Try these with anything from Bruce Hornsby to Elton John or perhaps the Lord of the Rings soundtrack. Listen to "The Breaking of the Fellowship" and "May It Be." I've found this particular piece to be one of the most challenging songs for any set of speakers to reproduce accurately. With lesser headphones, you'll get chalkiness in Enya's voice, especially toward the end of the song. Also, the drum riff in Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is simply something that you have to hear for yourself. Lyle Mays' solo in "James" on Pat Metheny Group's "Offramp" sounds terrific. Listening to the Police "Every Breath You Take," you can hear the gentle swipe of the cymbals. So far, these have handled any music that I've put through them. Depending on your MP3 player (B&0 BeoSound 2), the volume can be extremely loud so be mindful of that. A song such as Patti Smith's "So You Wanna Be (a Rock 'n Roll Star)" can really hurt. My friend says he sometimes gets cord noise -- which was mentioned by another reviewer here. He said when the cord rubs against his short collar, he'll sometimes hear it. I haven't noticed that, and I generally wear them while walking from the bus stop (roughly eight city blocks) or parking lot (15 city blocks). But I usually keep my MP3 player in my shirt pocket and the cord coiled, so possibly that is either reducing or eliminating cord noise. I have no problem recommending these. Plus, they come with a two-year warranty, which I've not seen before with these type of earphones. Sennheiser's customer service is first rate. A real person replies quickly to inquiries. I've had to use them twice, and turnaround time in both cases was about a week. So sit back in your favorite chair, throw on Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" and enjoy.

Here it is in a nutshell: These earphones sell for close to $85.00 at Circuit City and maybe a little less in other areas. I paid, with shipping, around $20.00. Quality? I generally use these for exercising, riding the bike, and sometimes relaxing at home. I have tried a few other brands including a $250.00 pair of Shure's but nothing, and I mean nothing has come close to the quality of these Sennheiser's. Maybe the other well know brands are good for sitting quietly at home listening to music but for my purposes, these are awesome!

For the price, it's pretty hard to find this kind of quality. These are keepers! However, a few words of advice and caution: 1) In order to experience the deep bass that they claim to produce, you must achieve a tight fit. To do this, you must use the largest ear-fit-rings that your ear-holes will allow. 2) Achieving a tight fit (effectively blocking all outside noise) has side effects ... cable movement and chewing is heard through the ear plugs. On a scale of 1-10, the bass is an eight. I expected deeper bass, but this is pretty good. The midtones are great, and the highs are sharp (maybe too sharp). Like I said, for the price, you'll find none better.

Header: Wonderful headphones, January 2, 2007
Comment:
I am not a avid audio equipment buyer, and I am on a rather strict budget. I do love music however, and decided that perhaps I should invest in something that I could listen to it in higher quality. After careful consideration of all the Sennheiser headphones ~&lt; 50$ on this website, I had ended up buying these. I read a couple good reviews for these (and had seen the rest), and then looked up at all the negative ones. Here are all the negative traits and positive feedback (or negative feedback) I've noticed after buying this product and throughly reading reviews.. 1) -The design- Pros: The right earphone cord was longer than the left, and it was most likely designed using behind the head style. I wasn't sure if I would like this, and thought this would be the greatest drawback, as I had seen the same design be terribly wrong. However! These headphones are actually quite easy to wear, and actually somewhat stylish. They're not quite as messy because of the cord design, and for me they get snagged on things less and I am less likely to rip them out, because there is essentially only one cord to handle. I have never used an In Ear Monitor(IEM) before, but these things are MUCH better and comfortable than just about all the previous headphones I have used. Not only are they rather comfortable and don't seem to leave any pain or impression in your ears, they stay in amazingly well. I went for a jog and I didn't have any of the problems I have had with previous earbud headphones in the past. Also, I think it's useful to note that the connector is a 90 degree connector. I have found these to be more fragile on occasion, but I can only wait and see, I have yet to have problems (and hopefully won't for a long long time). They give you three different sizes of tips for your ears. I myself had to change to the larger ones when I got them, and it's nice that they give you a choice. I feel like I am getting a good seal with the current size, but perhaps I could get a better one? If you are afraid of this or find that you can't do any of the three sizes that come with it, you can go and buy you're own earbud tips, I hear this works well (and cheaply), and can increase sound quality. Possible negative: The cord length could be a problem for some people... I am an average sized person and can put my arm out all the way and there's still a decent amount of slack, however the cords are a little stiff, and perhaps it might not give some people the freedom they want. I personally am fine with it, these are fine for walking, running, and going about daily business in your jean or coat pockets. Conclusion: The design is rock solid, if you don't mind an average length cord and a seemless behind the head wire style. 2) -The sound- Pros: Where do I begin? I listen to every genre, and everything from Verdi's Aida to Devin Townsend Band's Synchestra sound absolutely amazing. From the quietest of quiet to the loudest of loud, these headphones are the best I've ever owned in sound quality. I am just afraid that if I turn it up too much I may just go deaf :X. Luckily for me their noise isolating technology works wonderfully. I took a walk and it seemed almost dream-like as the cars seemed to be gliding by, making a very soft and ambient noise. You can play your music very softly, at a low volume setting, and still hear it very clearly. No longer will you be bothered by people who have muffler problems, crazy construction noise, and the general bustle of the things around you. It's almost eerie to pause your music and feel the sweet silence that these headphones give you. These headphones are obviously closed ear earbuds, which makes really nice for if you're going into a library, office, or home and do not want to disturb anyone with you're music, which is precisely what I was looking for considering headphone noise is considered the number one most obnoxious noise in public areas. Possible negatives: Well, if you don't get a good seal, then you can invest 10 more bucks for better eartips and it'll sound pretty good. I can't imagine how good these are in the professional market, but then also if someone is buying these headphones for ~50$ coming down from equipment that is ~>300$ (not that price always makes the headphone), then perhaps it is obvious that these headphones will not be able to hold up as well to them. However, I think that they can hold their own as a satisfactory competitor to even the most powerful of Bose audio equipment. Definite negatives: Just because they sound good and have good isolation from noise, a big problem is cord noise. Any physical movement at all touching these cords, or even walking gives the impression that you're very very lightly tapping a drum to the beat of your footsteps. I have to say that it's very easy to overlook when you have music playing, but when running or jogging this can be somewhat more noticeable. I have gotten over it, but if you are looking for something that has a much more seemless experience you may want to try open air headphones, as noise isolation is probably causing the problem but giving you such good sound quality, but you'll sacrifice the privacy of listening to your music and not broadcasting your music. Overall conclusion: If you are looking for good sound quality, noise reduction, and design; and you can also get over the fact that cord noise is there, these headphones might just be what you're looking for. I certainly think they were what I was looking for, and I give these 5 stars regardless of cord noise.

I got the CX300's from an Amazon listed "other" supplier in China. The earbuds came in a simple box with no Mfg Info, therefore I question if I got China Knockoff's instead of first line product. The earbuds sound better than my old Sony 51's, however the cables are stiff and therefore transfer sound whenever they touch anything. My old Sony earbuds have a very plyable cable and transfers minimal touch noise.

Comment:
I just bought a second pair of these CX300-B earbuds directly from Amazon for a christmas present. I already own a pair purchased from Amazon earlier this year and I am very happy with their performance! I was concerned because the buds I received from Amazon in December seem to be made from a shinier appearing plastic than my buds purchased this summer. They used to be made from a matte slightly bumpy black plastic and the new buds are shiny black plastic. There are a lot of knockoffs of this model floating around and I wanted to be sure I got the genuine article... I emailed Amazon asking about the different appearance and they suggested I contact Sennheiser. I called Sennheiser USA, and Erik the product manager confirmed that the buds are now being made from a shinier-appearing plastic. Hope this helps calm your fears, if anyone else notices their newly purchased CX300-B buds look different from the old.

These CX300's sound amazing with great cord quality. The cords won't break down like Sony's. My piece of advise is to use the largest ear inserts! By using the largest size, you make your ear nearly airtight and the bass you can hear is DEEEEP. Its incredible. For the longest time I didn't try the largest size because I thought they were toooo big. I was wrong. Use the large!

these headphones are so nice. I bought these after reading some reviews that said that these headphones didn't deliver enough bass and other LIES! Seriously, if these sucked I would tell the whole world, but the matter of the fact is that these headphones are really good. The bass definately comes through, there is no need to adjust EQ because these headphones pump out enough bass for rock. Now if you are like those ridiculous people that turn the bass all the way up so that all you can hear is bass, then these arent for u. But for those who like to actually listen to the MUSIC these are persfect. The j shape makes it so that you can put these behind your neck and avoid the tangling that y shape headphones have. Not to mention these look really nice once you wear them, and the lenght of the chord is pretty long. I am 5'11 and I can put my ipod in my pocket and still have quite a bit of chord hanging from my pocket. The only thing that I was kind of pissed about was that they feel very weird the first days you use these headphones. Hopefully just like everything else, i will be able to get used to these. These headphones come with three different sizes for the rubber that goes in your ear canal. I found that the small fits perfectly for me, they drown out outside sound and give a deeper bass. The price is not to bad compared to other headphones of this quality, just check out some Shures.

Comment:
I've been using Bose headphones...state of the art. So, I didn't expect much when I put these in my ears...just hoped that they would suffice, since lugging around larger headphones has become unworkable. Wow, was I surprised! They sound great. They're not surround-sound...but they will give you your music in a private quiet that's amazingly rich, given their tiny size. Since having one side of their attached wires longer, they go around the back of your head and don't hang in front, they're very unobtrusive...I live in a big city, and not advertising that I might be listening to an iPod is a big advantage. I can't imagine why anyone (another reviewer) would complain about these.

Comment:
An excellent value. The buds recreates sound into clear, distinct sounds. they seem pretty accurate for buds. The resolution is clear. The buds fit comfortably in my ear canals. An Ipod has more than enough power to get lots of sound. I have not given them an opportunity to break in, but I am sure that they can only get better. The buds come with three possible rubbery end pieces to establish a tight fit. The one downside is that the buds do not come with any type of case or container to transport them so that they will last a long time. I have purchased the Shure zippered carrying case that has a spool inside to wrapp up the cables. It is a handy way to carry the headphones since they do not come with a case. These buds are really a good deal. If you want really boomy base with a fuzzy indistinct sound, get the Bose buds. Amazon Market Place has been blowing out these headphones for as little as $12.00-$18.00 per pair in the white model. This makes these little earbuds an absolute steal!!!!

Header: Superb in-ear phones for the money, September 6, 2007
Comment:
Let me preface by saying that I own several pairs of dramatically pricier earbuds by different manufacturers; the one I'm glaring at as I write this were manufactured by a company who's name begins with an 'S' and rhymes with 'bony', dusty and neglected on my desk. Another pair I'm 'shure' are inferior, especially considering their nearly 4x higher price-point. In none of these have I found anything that can approach the quality and clarity of a half-decent pair of cans (enclosed, over-ear speakers). Enter the Sennheiser CX300-B. For the entry-level price, I wasn't expecting much from them, despite the reputable Sennheiser brand name. When I first threw them into my MP3 player, I was proven pleasantly unprepared for the clear and even highs and lows which emanated from these lightweight, comfortable headphones. I gladly put them to the test early on with a wide and varied array of music, from Vivaldi and Pachelbel to Miles Davis and Ahmad Jamal, Clash, Billy Bragg and Buzzcocks (and nearly everything in-between). These speakers were well-balanced enough to cope with the most driving and arrogant Bad Religion to the softest and most subdued piano bar splashes. Some owners complained about them sounding to bright or too bassy. I'm sure these people are not exaggerating, for any speakers which must be inserted into the ear-canals are a matter of some precision. Too far in, and you may feel that your brain is being drilled out by rabid chipmunks. Not far enough and the bass leaks out, leaving your music sounding less than engaging. These problems are common to any 'earbud' type phones, and may be further exacerbated by the natural design of your own ear canal. In my own experience with the CX300-B, they were the perfect fit when using the largest of the three sets of removable gaskets provided in the retail packaging. Being a white male (we have the widest ear canals), the largest were the only ones which sealed properly. Even so, they feel much more comfortable than any of the other models I've used to date. As for the sound, I found the sweet spot of perfect bass and tone was very easily and naturally achieved without much invasive ear-probing, which I can certainly live without. Your ears being unique creations, your own milage may vary on both of these critical points. If you have hundreds to spend and want the convenience of in-ear speakers, you undoubtedly will be able to find what you're seeking among the pricey and high-end of the well known brands. For those of us who have not the luxury (or inclination) to spend so much on the most portable of headphones, these are exceedingly difficult to defeat in the arena of bang for your buck. EDIT: Since I wrote this review, I had two different friends pickup CX-300's on my recommendation. Both opted for the &lt; $20 retailers, and both ended up with fakes. Generally speaking, if you bought them for a similar price new, you can bet that they're counterfeit, which I've begun calling "Fakeheisers". These are good knockoffs; unless you had a pair of real Sennheisers to compare them with it'd be hard to tell the difference in appearance without disassembly. The sound though, is far, *far* inferior to the real thing. If you want Sennheiser quality, buy from a reputable dealer. If you try to get the lowball deal, you might as well continue using the cheap ones that came with your MP3 player.

Header: The Best Headphones I have Ever Had, February 9, 2007
Comment:
I've tried various Creative, over-priced Bose (I never thought I would say such things against Bose), Sony, Shure, etc. ear buds...while there are better headphones out there, these are the best value by far. They block out 90% of outside sound, and that is with no music on. Once you press play say goodbye to the noises of the outside world; crying children on your commute, airplane engines, chatty girlfriends watching Grey's Anatomy...they are all gone, and this is on the LOWEST volume setting of your MP3 player. Overall, I highly suggest you pick these up if you are in the market for earbuds under $100. I can't say how they perform in the gym as I have cheaper headphones I use for that.

I use these on a Cowan Audio U2 MP3 player mainly while exercising. I did have to route the cable behind my head. I was lucky that the default (medium) sized earplugs fit perfectly. When seated properly the sound, bass included, is exceptional. I minimized the microphonic effect of the cord moving by using a small alligator clip that I happened to have. I have not had any problems with the ear plugs working loose during exercise while on my elliptical machine. I would recommend these earphones to anyone including my audiophile friends.

Comment:
These ear buds are worth the money; especially if you are buying (or have) an MP3 player that come with the standard, foam covered, always fall out, ear buds. I use them for long distance running and not only do they not fall out, they do not become uncomfortable after prolonged wear. One drawback is that the right ear bud has a longer cord than the left, causing the weight and the movement of the cords to be felt mostly on the left ear. Not serious, but annoying at times. Overall; an excellent investment for those of you who truly enjoy listening to music.

Comment:
I've had my earbuds for about 3 months and I was really never impressed. Maybe I expected too much from some $50 earbuds, but after reading all the user reviews I thought I was going to get a great set of earbuds. The sound always sounded "stuffy" and not very clear; really didn't seem to matter what I did to the EQ. The fit on these is OK, I could really never get them to get a nice fit no matter what size fitting I used. The worst part is that my left earbud has no sound now at all and this is after very infrequent gentle use for 3 months. UPDATED... Sennheiser does have quick and friendly repair service and they let me get a different (more expensive) pair of headphones and no cost

Comment:
I got it from amazon for $40 shipped. With this price, I would highly recommend it to anyone who plans to upgrade the original earphone comes with your mp3 player or ipod, especially, you need noise cancellation. I don't like Sennheiser playing price game, in the first few weeks of this CX 300 coming out, MSRP at senn web site was $49, amazon sell it for $39. I think this is reasonable price for entry-level IEM. Now, they jack price up to $69 b/c of good reviews. I personally will not buy CX 300 at price $60. Instead, I will go buy creative EP-630 (about $26 in amazon), which is considered using same driver as cx 300(there is still debating about it, and no any confirmation for producers). Check previous review about history of MD33,EP630, IE4, CX300. Regardless, EP-630 at $26 is your solid alternative choice.

I also like the clean, no nonsense design of the CX 300B. As of this writing, it also appears to be better and yet less expensive then the competition. It's a no brainer folks. Sennheiser has hit a home-run with this one. I highly recommend this product.

Header: Fantastic IEMs, ESPECIALLY for the price, February 22, 2006
Comment:
I've tried pretty much all of the budget IEMs, and one more high-end set. These include the JVC black in-ears, the Sony 51s, the Panasonic HJEP50s, and the Shure e2c. Unfortunately, there are problems with all of them. For instance, the Sonys are the worst of the bunch, with nothing but colored and overpowering bass and a lack of highs and clarity, the Panasonics starve for more bass, and the e2c are highly uncomfortable. The JVC's almost get it, but they lose a bit of clarity as well. Think of them as a slightly better Sony pair. Now, onto these fantastic Senns. I was a little nervous because I've never spent more than $25 on earphones before, but I saw these at J&R and I couldn't resist plucking down the $50. Honestly, I can say that I'd pluck down twice as much for phones this good. The bass is outstanding without being overpowering, and the amount of clarity and detail that you start to pick up is very, very refreshing. It's a whole new experience with these phones, and I'm very glad I picked them up. Do yourself a favor and do the same!

Header: A best buy-- no wonder the price went up, April 14, 2006
Comment:
So these used to cost about 30 dollars? Now they're around 55 bucks. No matter, they're worth it and then some. I can turn off the EQ setting on my iPod now. The 300s seem made to enhance and enrich mp3s and WAVs. The only downside is that if you have garbage recordings, they'll sound harsher and nastier. Garbage in, garbage out. These buds need less wattage to crank, which saves iPod battery life and reduces distortion. At the same time, the airy highs and satisfying bass (make sure you have the right size and style of earpads) allow monitoring at moderate levels with a sense of punch and detail normally found only when you crank other phones way up. I still value my hearing, so these are all great attributes to me. I have Shure EC3's which I bought for iPod use and onstage monitoring. I also own the EC2's, and several other studio and home headphones. These little buds are at least as high quality as the rest, at a fraction of the price.

Header: Great earphones!!!, April 14, 2006
Comment:
This is my 3rd set of in-ear phones and definetly the best!! My first was Etymotic ER-6i and they are sooooo clear but are uncomfortable and have zero bass response. They do the best job as blocking outside noise because they go DEEP in your ear, hence the lack of comfort. The next was a pair of sonys, ex71's I believe and they are the most comfortable of the 3. They have nice bass but lack some clarity because of it. Nice though. I recommend them. Pretty good job at blocking outside noise. They also have the annoying behind the neck design. The Sennheiser CX300B are the best sounding of the 3. Very clear with great separation and good bass. They aren't quite as comfy as the ex71s but are just fine. Much better then the etymotics though. Equal to the sony's in blocking outside noise. They also have the behind the neck cord design. That is the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars. If you don't mind that design then they'd be a 5. If they made these with a normal Y-shaped cord they would be perfect.

I'm happy to say I finally found moderately-priced, high-quality ear buds for my MP3 player. And ones that fit my ears! All of the ear buds I've tried have been too big for my ear canals. The Sennheiser CX 300's fit my ear canals with the smallest fit sleeves after a bit of adjusting. They're a dream on the commuter train, as they are noise canceling. I got them from Amazon for $39 with free shipping and consider this a great bargain. I would buy them now for $69, knowing how wonderful they are. I just ordered replacement fit sleeves directly from Sennheiser ($18 for 10 fit sleeves), as I realized that I couldn't bear to be without my CX 300's if something happened to a fit sleeve or if I accidentally lost one. (I must say, however, the fit sleeves are on tight and have stayed on during cleaning, so I'm not sure if I will ever need the replacements.) If you're looking for crystal clear sound, good bass, and lightweight ear buds with an asymmetrical cord, buy the Sennheiser CX 300's - you won't be disappointed!

Header: Why is the right ear cable so long?, February 11, 2006
Comment:
The previous reviewer's only complaint with these IEMs was that the cable for the right ear is longer than the left, leading him to tie it off as a means of shortening it. What some people don't realize is that the cable on these headphones is not meant to dangle under the chin. Instead, the cable for the right earbud is meant to go behind your head and rest on your neck. This gets the cables out of your way, and it's a much more comfortable design than the traditional "Y-style" cable. As for quality, these sound great. I could debate whether they are better than offerings from other brands, but nobody else offers anything close to this quality at this price. So if you're on a budget, your search may just begin and end here. What more can I say? Great sound, amazing value...jump on this!

Comment:
Purchased from "Deals on Wheels". the package were sealed and stated that is was "Made in China". Genuine Sennheiser Products are manufactured in the US or Germany. Not China. The earbuds were the best fakes of these that I have seen. The various guides for buying Genuine CX300's have not been updated for these newer fakes. They look 100% Genuine except that it is made in china and the metal band is not attached properly on the earpiece.seller got a 3 because the sound quality was decent for $26.64. the metal band looks 100% genuine except for the fact that there is a gap between the band and the plastic.the mesh looks genuine also. the cord material and rubber connector looked and felt Genuine also.The part that annoyed me to most was that the left earpiece makes a plastic crunching sound when fitting them in your ear. That was a dead giveaway that these were fakes. another giveaway sign is the band that i talked about earlier.the Genuine earpiece band is 100% flush to the plastic.The Genuine CX300 was discontinued over 2 years ago so thats the 3rd Giveaway that the CX300-W's and most likely the CX300 black variant from "Deals on Wheels" are Really legit looking fakes. Also, None of the Amazon Merchants selling these are Authorized Sennheiser Dealers. BTW, the "Deals" from "Deals on Wheels" stands for really good deals (for them) by selling Counterfeit Products to people like us.

Header: Excellent Sound but not good while walking or jogging, October 3, 2010
Comment:
There is no doubt that the sound quality is pretty good but only when you are sitting in one place. The design has some major flaw. The noise isolating ear pads and cord work together like a stethoscope. Even a smallest touch or movement of the cord creates heartbeat like sound, so when I am walking or jogging, I continuously keep getting this added heartbeat sound. It annoys me a lot and I don't know who would like a headphone that is good in isolating external noise but adds its own. A tall person(more than 6') will definitely feel that the cord is a little short and because of left side being shorter than right side, my left side earbud slips off very often if I try to stretch my head away. One more thing as a side note. I bought this item from Amazon and the product description said that the earphone had a black carrying case too. After receiving the item I didn't see any carrying case. I contacted Amazon, they accepted that the product description was wrong and they sent me a case free of cost. I always love Amazon for their excellent customer service.

Header: Truly over-rated, September 4, 2010
Comment:
Despite buying from Amazon for many years, this is my first review. While these headphones are tolerable, I feel the current reviews clearly have these rated nearly comically high. While others feel spending $30 on a pair of earbuds is a budget purchase, I find it to be a fair amount of money for a simplistic product. I've churned through plenty of earbuds in my day. I'm not of the belief that you cannot get a quality earbuds for under $30. My primary comparison is to my repeated purchase of the Philips SHE-9500 earbuds which are now no longer being manufactured. The quality of the Philips SHE-9500 ($23) versus these $30 earbuds isn't even a fair fight. The Philips have more adjustable fittings, much better bass response, and overall dramatically better build quality. I can accept having to purchase a new pair every 9 months or so due to heavy daily use. These earbuds have measurably bad build quality compared to the Philips earbuds. They are extraordinarily delicate compared to the now discontinued Philips SHE-9500s. The base quality is poor. I was of the opinions that anything with the Sennheiser name must be of high quality. That assumption was quickly proven to be false. The major issues are 1) poor quality bass, 2) delicate cord, and 3) poorly fitting earbuds. So while this wasn't my worst purchase ever, I feel these earbuds are overrated. If you want a name brand earbud, look elsewhere. Slapping Sennheiser on the package doesn't make these worth your hard earned money.

Comment:
My biggest discrepancy with this item isn't the overall cord length, which definitely needs to be increased by a few inches, but the way the lengths of each cord differ once they split. The cord to the left ear bud is substantially shorter than the right, so that's where the weight is distributed, making it extremely difficult to keep the left ear bud properly seated. It's too bad because these are probably the most comfortable buds I've found for myself (I've been through 13 pair in the last year, or so, in search of my ideal pair). Sound quality is ok and noise isolation could stand some improvement, but I was willing to overlook those factors based on fit alone. Oh well...

I've had these buds for 4 months. Sound is good but the cord design is bizarre. The difference in lengths between the right and left streams, and the thin gauge of the wire, makes for a very floppy and annoyingly uncomfortable wear.

Header: Good Sound Isolation, inexpensive, but lots of "cord" noise, March 17, 2010
Comment:
This is a decent pair of headphones. BUT, the major drawback is that there is tons of noise if the cord touches ANYTHING. If you go running you will be hearing a bassy noise from the cord bouncing around that will be super distracting. So I don't really recommend this set for runners or people who do other physical activity. Even as I sit at my desk and listen on headphones, from time to time I hear that super distracting bouncy noice from the cable touching my shirt, my hand, or whatever. With that said, there are positives too: I like the rubber earbud options, the fit they make, and the noise cancellation (with the exception of the noisy cord) and the sound is pretty good. There is some bass, which, compared to many other headphones is a big plus. Decent if you are at a desk, sitting on a train or plane. Not good if you are an athlete who expects to use these earbuds while exercising.

I wanted ear buds that I could wear under my motorcycle helmet that would not put pressure on my ears from the ear bud itself or the little arm. These are compact and I can't even feel them with my helmet on. The sound quality is better than any I have ever had in the same price range. I don't have to turn my Ipod volume up as high as other ear buds I have had which saves on battery. The only thing I don't like is that the length of the wire on one side is shorter than the other ... never understood that design. But it is no big deal, just a matter of preference. Would definitely recommend these ear buds over any other ear buds in a similar price range. (I Can't compare them to higher price range ear buds because I have not owned any to compare them to)

Header: Basic good sounding earbuds, December 31, 2009
Comment:
I'm not an audiophile. The earbuds sound good, perhaps too bassy, but that seems to be adjustable with my EQ. The cord is parallel strands for 34 inches, then split asymmetrically, 7 inches to the left earbud, 21 inches to the right earbud. Everything about these earbuds seems a little small/flimsy: the body of the jack, the wires, the mounting of the wires to the earbuds. On the one hand, this eliminates bulk, but it feels as if one wrong tug and something is going to give. These eardbuds came with no carrying case nor a clip so I had to reuse the ones from from my Sony earbuds. My Sondy earbuds are overall longer (48 inches on round cable before the asymmetrical split, 4 inches to the left earbud, and 21 inches to the right earbud). I haven't determined yet if the shorter cord is going to be an issue while on my walks, but I imagine it won't.

Comment:
I purchased a pair of these for $30 shipped. I had purchased another pair previously for $16 shipped. Both are not fake. However, beware of cheap knock-offs. I was sure the $16 pair was fake but they turned out to be real; sometimes you can find a really good deal. There are some sophisticated fakes that are even being sold by reputable sellers due to the fact that they cannot tell a difference. Google around for tutorials that show differences. Anyway, these are a great set of headphones. I've noticed slight discomfort with long use but it's not too bad. They do a good job of blocking ambient noise. For such a cheap price you can't go wrong, I believe you will be thoroughly surprised. These headphones come with an asymmetrical cable. You put the left earbud in your left ear and the right earbud behind your neck, instead of in front, and into your right ear. At first I did not understand why the cable was like this but it makes much more sense once you use it correctly.

Header: Fantastic headphones for the price., November 10, 2009
Comment:
At over a thousand reviews, there's not much I can add besides saying that for the price, these headphones are amazing. I'm not an audio engineer or someone who listens to every minute detail, but for $20 these sound significantly better than the standard iPod and Zune headphones. The bass sounds deep, there's no 'grumbling' sound when the volume is too loud. These headphones have been through a lot. I've owned them for about a year, and they have been through both washer and dryer, then a few months later the washer again. They get beat up in my pocket when I'm walking and not wearing them, and they sound just as good as when I first bought them.

Header: Outstanding Earbuds - Highly Recommend, October 24, 2009
Comment:
I highly recommend these earbuds to anyone on a budget. I didn't have a lot to spend (less than $30) and have purchased many in this price range from local stores such as Philips, Sony, and JVC. Without a doubt or hesitation I can say these are the best overall earbuds I have ever used. For reference I have a Microsoft Zune 80GB as my portable media player. Let me go through the points: Comfort: - These earbuds fit perfectly into my ears. They come with two additional earbud sizes to customize them to your ears, but I did not need them. - They are very light and have a low profile. When placed in my ears, they hardly extend out past my earlobes and stay clear of everything. Sound Quality: -The fit and noise isolation of these headphones means that I can actually hear my music versus the world around me. I was VERY surprised at how well external sound was blocked. You may not approve but I use these earbuds while riding and the road noise and wind are now virtually non-existent. I no longer have to run my Zune at  volume or more just to hear the music. Outstanding. - I am not an audio snob, hence the use of a Zune and the Zune Pass music, but they sound great to me. Maybe a touch soft on the low end but otherwise perfect. Durability: - Can't really rate yet. They are fairly new still. No issues so far. Cord Length: - I am 5'10 and I can comfortably have my Zune in my jean pocket without issue. They cord is the wrap around type such that one earbud cord is longer than the other. Works well for me. Value for Money: - Outstanding. I have paid more for earbuds at local retailers that do not fit as well, isolate sound as well, or deliver such smooth sound. These come from a reputable manufacturer and are greatly priced. Style: - They are small, light, and fit snugly into my ear. The black earbuds and cord are subtle and look very well made. Packaging: - Umm, to me this thing was harder to get open than Fort Knox. Blister packs are hateful but I understand why they are necessary. I might have missed the "Easy Open" tab, but basically I had to get a torch and some TNT to get these things out of their package. Other than the super secure package, it was fine. Item Design: - Again, they fit GREAT, isolate sound wonderfully, sound fine, and are an amazing value. If you are looking for a replacement set of earbuds for your iPod or Zune or whatever, I would highly recommend these. They are an amazing value and I am going to purchase another set for my wife. What are you waiting for?

Comment:
I recently received these Seinheisser CX300-B Earbuds and the J2 Premium Earbuds. The Seinheisser earbuds were for my girlfriend and the J2 for myself. After trying her Seinheisser earbuds, I became hooked to it! And I ended up ordering a pair for myself. Comfort: Provides a very solid and full fit that does not leave any awkward space in your ear. These earbuds are truly designed to fit into your ear with no fiddling with the end to get it inside. Sound: Clean, crisp sound. Paired with the excellent comfort, the rich audio gave me a very satisfying listening experience. Seinheisser does it again with their excellent sound quality that made the J2 Earbuds I got even less satisfying. There are no harsh frequencies and instead provide pleasant sounds. Durability: Very durable and feels like $50 earbuds but are priced for only $16! Style: These look and feel great. My only complaint is that I personally don't like the earbuds that wrap around your neck. Otherwise, these look good. Value: This is what makes this product that much more desirable. You get great earbuds for the price.

Header: I'll be jammed, September 1, 2009
Comment:
These are fantastic. I have had a lot of earphones, buds, etc. They all claimed to have great bass. Yeah, whatever. These actually do. I found out by accident. I'm a guy. I don't read the instructions, still haven't. I always thought you jammed these things in your ear canal. They come with the medium set of soft rubber cups attached. They sounded okay. You know how if you push the earbud farther into your ear with your finger, they sound a little louder, and the bass seems to be a little better. Well, I switched to the smaller set of rubber cups, thinking they would go farther into my ear canal, thus sounding better. Hello in there. Oh shxt, no bass at all, Alvin and the chipmunks singing. So, I tried the largest rubber cups, what the heck. Funniest thing, the bass was fantastic. Evidently, they work like little subwoofers in your ears. I didn't jam them in my ear canals, but they did seal off my inner ear to the outside world. I'm using this with a Touch 2g, equalizer off. If you get these and you aren't getting crazy bass and great highs, before you hit the equalizer, try the big rubber cups. If this is working for you, you should be able to hear the vibration of the cord if it rubs against something (attach a cord clip), and if you chew something, your chewing sounds like Godzilla. I realize that this is somewhat subjective, mainly if these things don't fit your ears, not your ear canals, your SOL, but it's only $15, and if they fit they sound like you paid $100.

Header: Good for the price if the price is half price., August 27, 2009
Comment:
I was all excited when these ear buds went on sale for less than $20. I had been looking at them for a long time but didn't want to pay $50 for them. Boy, am I glad I waited. These little buds are not worth the original price. They sound good, they are very accurate, but they have some big drawbacks. They say they have super bass. That is a lie. I have to shove them as far in my ear as they will go to even hear the bass. If I turn up the bass on the player's equalizer it distorts. The cable is very thin and picks up every little noise. As I walk along I can hear the cable bounce on my chest. If the wind is blowing I can hear that too. It is quite annoying. Also, the thin cable tangles easily. I am always having to untangle it, even when I am wearing it. The left wire is shorter than the right wire and that makes the right wire dangle and get caught in the buttons on my shirt. I don't know how many times I have turned my head and one of the buds falls out. I will repeat that these buds do have very accurate sound, that is why I gave them three stars, but you need to sit still when you use them and they do block out sounds very well. They are good for classical and jazz but not for bassier music like pop or techno or rap. I have other Sennheiser headphones and I love them dearly but the CX300s disappointed me.

Header: Excellent headphones, August 15, 2009
Comment:
The Sennheiser CX300's are a steal for the price. Let's start with the build quality: -The CX300's are small compared to other in-ear headphones. Each piece is very small and will not stick out very much. My Skullcandy Ink'd in-ear headphones are larger and every thing is just bulkier. The audio jack is small, and shaped with a curve so it doesn't stick out of your player like the iPod headphones or the Ink'd phones. The cord is thinner than others but still strong. Sennheiser did a good job on compaction. -The materials are of high quality and the finish is very shiny on the inserts (If you have a LEGIT product, buy from J&R, they buy directly from Sennheiser). -There are three sizes the headphones come with, like most in-ear headphones, from small, to medium, to large. -Some one on Youtube said that she thinks the little rubber sleeves are of low quality and flimsy; well my Skullcandy Ink'd headphones have more durable rubber and are less comfortable. The CX300's have almost the exact same size rubber sleeves, but since they are softer and more "flimsy" they are MUCH more comfortable. The comfort is extremely amazing and the CX300's feel almost as welcoming as iPod headphones. Now the sound quality: First of all, to get the full experience you have to break into the headphones. It wont be a few hours of use until they are performing the best they can. I am writing this next section on the pre-break in period and then a post-break in period review after. -The bass is stronger than any earbuds (such as the iPod earbuds) naturally because they make a tighter fit directing more music to the canal. But when comparing to other in-ear (canal) headphones, these make a tighter, cleaner, sounding bass. The bass is not out of control, and though still enjoyable, again not like many other in-ear headphones which may or may not make people happy about them. - The mid range at pre-break is similar or possibly a bit better than the Skullcandy Ink'd ($15.99) in-ear headphones. I am guessing by the time I break these in enough it will improve and become more vibrant and clear. -The high range does stand out like mentioned in other reviews, and provides you very clear high tones. Even at pre-break the high range beats the Skullcandy Ink'd phones by a lot. The Skullcandy headphones can get a bit degraded or distorted up there, but the Sennheisers do not. -Overall, at the pre-break in period, every thing is sounding superb, fresh and clean. The comfort only adds to the enjoyment and listening experience. Coming soon: post-break in period (I will be comparing the CX300's to the Skullcandy headphones again) *UPDATE* Post-break in period review: It is amazing how easy it is to notice the difference between the Sennheiser head phones and the Skull Candy headphones. Here is a quick summary of the post break in results: Playing "Scream" by Avenged Sevenfold, it is very easy to notice that the Senneheiser's have a MUCH more vibrant, full sound. The actual bit rate sounds degraded with the SkullCandy's, and the bass is also well over done with the SkullCandy's. The Sennheiser headphones are more comfortable, sound more vibrant, and sound is more balanced. Playing "Boom Boom Pow" by the Black Eyed Peas, the sound is also more balanced and the sound quality is more vibrant and realistic. Because the SkullCandy's have more bass, the Black Eyed Peas sound more "pumped" with them, but that still doesn't diminish the fact that the Sennheiser's have better overall sound quality. In a short conclusion, the Sennheiser headphones did in fact improve over the month period of listening, and I would definitely recommend them over the Skullcandy INK'D headphones. The price seemed to lower on amazon, but just for the example, five bucks extra over the Skullcandy headphones is the best deal you can ever get for in-ear headphones for the quality. If you are going to buy ANY in-ear headphones within the $30 dollar range, these are the absolute BEST that exist. Post a comment if you disagree or have an opinion. Note: These headphones are extremely good for the price. I am not comparing these to 100-300 dollar headphones when I say "excellent." The CX300's are currently priced at around $20.00 online, and I am comparing them with my $15.00 Skullcandy headphones which are the closest I have in price.

Header: For those who say this has a 'tinny' sound, July 1, 2009
Comment:
If you end up getting these earbuds, they will sound a little 'tinny' at first. The diaphragm needs to 'burn in' for 50+ hours. Some say more, some say less, others say the burn-in process never ends, and still others say it doesn't make any difference. I can hear a distinct difference in the richness and 'warmth' of these earbuds since I first started using them. After the first 20 hours the tin had gone, and by 100 hours, the bass filled out. They sound amazing. If you have a return policy anyway, why notjust burn them in for a few days? [...] I use the pink noise, but any will do. Set the file to repeat and let it run through the earbuds each night or while you sleep. It really works. The thing that seems to disappoint the people who are dissatisfied with Sennheiser products is the bass isn't BOOMing when their listening to their music...which is fine, but a proper bass response won't boom like you hear in those cars with their subwoofers blasting or that is commonly hyped in some musical styles. It should have deep resonance, but be a tight sound. Sennheiser has an excellent frequency response across the 20-20k range +/- as does Klipsch (merely my opinion). If you're looking for some more surreal boom in that bass, checkout Sony MDR EX75, or some v-moda models. If you're an audiophile on a budget, and if you're considering spending $[...] on earbuds, that's probably who you are, get these, burn them in, and enjoy. They are worth it if great sounding music is important to you.

Comment:
Hi. There are many glowing reviews of these earbuds and I did a lot of research prior purchasing. One example [...]. One thing that I did not consider was the problem of earwax. Although I am careful to keep myself clean, inserting an object into your ear canal will inevitably result in some wax building up on the outer surface of the seals. You must take care to keep these surfaces clean. The sound will blow you away! Deep bass below your detection threshold as well as good vocal presence and an upper frequency limit that only your dog will hear. These earbuds will isolate you from just about all room noise. This can be a bit disconcerting when you hear your own heartbeat and breathing as the loudest sounds in the room!

Header: good, but watch out for 'line bumps', May 29, 2009
Comment:
I purchased these to make lawn mowing a little less painful. I needed some noise cancellation, but didn't want to spend the big bucks for active cancellation. They work fine for that. BUT, these ear-canal-type headphones transmit all manner of bumps to your line cord right up to your ears. When I'm not moving on my tractor, this isn't an issue, so I'm happy. But I don't think they would work well if you were using them and actively moving a lot, say during exercise. I suppose if I were more careful with the placement of the cord and my Ipod, this would go away. But I don't want to have to think about that, really. Of course, I don't think this has anything to do with this particular brand or model. I think it's just part of the ear-canal-headphone experience.

These earbuds block out all ambient noise, so if you dont want to hear the outside world, you dont, just clear music or whatever. The other reveiws are quite accurate. The right ear cord is to long after the split in the cord. I had no problem with them falling out or fitting, they fit just like any other in ear buds. The cord length is sort of short. All of these are minor issues, the sound quality is way better than any of my previous ear phones. Do not buy these off ebay, they'll be fake knock offs. These earbuds will be ten times better, at a slightly higher cost than of the shelf. Luckily I only paid 15 bucks, but they were used in "like new condition", the price has been dropping about $30 to $36 at the time of this reveiw. april 2009.

Sound is great with these earbuds, but only if you're sitting still. If you move (walk, run), the cord's movement generates an odd sound that distorts the listening experience. This is something that does not even happen with the so-so earbuds that come with the iPod. I guess it has to do with the material the cord is made of.

Header: Great sound, infuriating packaging, February 28, 2009
Comment:
I just got these in the mail today. I picked them because Sennheiser makes fantastic professional quality headphones, and this was such a great deal. I always break my earbuds i am hoping these last longer than the other brands i have purchased. So, i got the package and immediately wanted to try them out. Seems like an easy task - however that was not the case. I must have spent 20 minutes trying to open these things. They are packaged in those annoying plastic form fitting boxes that are sealed shut. I tried cutting the edges off, didn't work, the seams are right up to the edge of the box. I took a knife to it, that didn't work either, the plastic was too thick. I ended up having to take my scissors and cut a hole from the hanging hole in the box and simply hack at it piece by piece. I ended up cutting my fingers and a piece out of my shirt before i finally got it open. I have never experienced such a hard time opening anything in my life. As soon as i pried the little earbuds out of their fort knox like enclosure i plugged them in and checked out the sound. Phew, what a sigh of relief, they of course sounded as great as Sennheiser products usually do. Clear tone with no tinniness and great bass. I definitely recommend the earbuds, just be prepared to have the battle of your life trying to get them out of their box!

Header: Has Drawbacks but Won't Disappoint, especially at this price., January 12, 2009
Comment:
These are my first sound isolating earbuds, previously I have only used the apple earbuds, but they kept breaking so I bought these. If you are used to the apple earbuds, you won't be disappointed with these. The sound quality is comparable. The overall tone of the apple earbuds is a tad better, but these earbuds have better bass and are louder. You will find you can keep the volume lower on these. On the iPod, I recommend that you tweak with the equalizer to make them sound good. They sound bad with the equalizer off and they don't sound good where I had the equalizer before. I have it on "acoustic" now and it's pretty good. The biggest drawback in my opinion is that vibrations in the earbud cords are transmitted directly into your ears. This is especially noticeable with the iPod off, but you can still hear it with the iPod on. Moving the iPod or turning your head, even a spirited enough walk will cause the effect. When your clothes or body brush past the cord the sound gets transmitted directly into your ears. If these headphones cost more than they do I would give them a much worse rating just because of this. I am hoping that in time i will get used to this. If you like do dance while listening, you may be affected. One cord is longer than the other on the earbuds. This design allows for the left earbud to go in your ear and the right earbud to go around the back of your head into your right ear. Failing to put the earbuds in your ear this way will result in the aforementioned effect becoming stronger. Please note that this sound is not very loud, but is very noticeable since the earbuds block out other sounds quite well. With the earbuds in and blocking out the sound of my typing, the keyboard is actually just as loud as the sound. The earbuds fit comfortably in my ears and don't feel like they are falling out, unlike the other sound isolating earbuds i've tried. Overall I am pleased with my purchase. I'm sure you can find better earbuds for not too much more but I think most people will find these more than adequate. They are the most comfortable earbuds i've used. These earbuds live up to the Sennheiser name as well as their pricepoint. If you are replacing broken iPod headphones, consider these. They are cheaper than the iPod headphones and less likely to break. I will miss having white earbuds though.

Personally, I find these to be an amazing set of earbuds. So much so, that I am actually writing my first Amazon review. After seeing all the reviews about horrible sound, I think those are just people that unluckily got a fake set. Which really, we can't even blame Amazon for, as they are at the mercy of the suppliers they buy from, who could have been duped as well. Either way, easy way to find out, is pull off the silicone earpiece, and look at the mesh screen. If it is on the outside they are fake, on the inside is real. Only reason I gave them a 4 rather than a 5, is I hate the cord.

I just recently got these and posted a review which somehow got lost so here's the redo. I purchased these to replace my Sony's since the left one had stopped working completely, causing a wobbly sound as I worked out, not great at all! I was concerned about the 'fake' issue but trusting Amazon I went ahead after reading a great review which cited correspondence with Sennheiser stating that Amazon is in fact an authorized retailer. I did compare the packaging to some pictures I found online (google Sennheiser fakes) and after I was convinced they were legit I let my husband cut them out of the packaging (I recommend using a knife or scissors and just cut in, it's quick!). I tried them out and was blown away by the major improvement over what I was used to. Great bass, wonderful clarity, and I was able to put my volume back down where it belonged from almost maxed out. I even ran up and down the stairs to simulate the gym. Cord noise was minimal, and to be expected from in-ear headphones (ever play with a stethoscope?) it just comes with the territory, but it was much less than my previous pair. This Monday I used my new 'phones at the gym for the first time and was thrilled to turn down the volume and still cover the loud spinning class who yells and screams and also barely hear the cord, but hear beautiful quality tunes. The medium buds fit perfectly into my teeny ears (iPod earbuds didn't even come close to fitting in there) and never once slipped out during 45 mins of cardio. I barely noticed they were in! The cord is better worn behind the neck as the packaging instructs. My sony's also had the asymmetrical cord, but 'proper' wearing didn't make a difference. With these the cord noise is much, much less when worn to the design. Great price. Great sound. Great buy. If for some reason you get yours and think it might be fake, just call up Amazon. I have heard only amazing things about their customer service! Just be sure you are buying from Amazon (page will show item eligible for Prime shipping) and not a third party since there is no good way to know how legit their suppliers are. Good luck!

Comment:
These headphones sound amazing, I couldn't ask for better quality in sound. The bass is deep and not rattly, just smooth and deep. I bought a pair and was really impressed so I bought a second pair when the right bud went out. I thought it wasn't a big deal, I probably just had bad luck. I bought two more pairs, a pair for me and a pair for a friend. My friend pair started losing connection about two months after I bought them, and a couple of weeks later mine started to lose connection too. It got worse and worse until my friends stopped working and my left bud died. I checked the warranty, since they came with a year of warranty but they expect you to pay a fee and shipping and handling, that would end up costing more than a new pair. I love the sound, but hate the quality of the physical product.

I ride a motorcycle and use the in canal headphones to fit under my helmet and as ear plugs to block out wind noise. I have a couple different models. I play all of them on my 30g zune. I listen to the music just loud enough to hear make out the words fairly clearly. Philips SHE9500 sounded good when in positioned perfectly. THe bass sounded good. They have more bass but not as sharp and clean. Like comparing a car stereo to a home theatre. The rubber surrounding were the wire goes in to the speaker is stiff and can irritate your ears if they are pointed up witch is nessisary when wearing a helmet. They aren't very secure when active either. The tredmill will knock them loose. My zune had to be turned up to 16 out of 20 on the volume. My sony MDR-AS40EX were very secure but at the expense of sound quality. The sound is not for audiophiles but they don't buy 30-40 dollar head phones. They do a good job of block out background noise. The zune volume is at 12 of 20 for these. My Sennheiser CX300 sound great. The very efficent speakers with the excellent background suppression is means a listening volume of 9 under my helmet. If you ride a bike you know this isn't bad. I finally get off my bike with out ringing ears after a 30 min ride. They seem to stay in place pretty well. If you need it to stay in place for sure. You can turn the head phones up and use the wire coming from the speaker to secure it by pushing it in the ridge in your outter ear. THis doesn't irritate the skin or cardilige as they are soft. The only complaint that I have is the left wire is rather short. So when wearing a arm banded Mp3 player it is hard to get the correct length of wire so you don't turn your head and pull out the left head phone and not have an abundance of wire bouncing around trying to dislodge your head phones. THis is why it doesn't get 5 stars. Still an excellent set of speakers but there may be better choices if you are getting them for the gym.

These are pretty much the same as the Creative EP630's. The only real difference I've been able to discern is the "J-shaped" design. That is, the cord goes up to the left ear, and then the cable for the right one is longer. These headphones are intended to go around your neck. Not as bad as you might think, but take note. Also, the jack is the "L" variety. The cable comes out perpendicular to the jack. Not a deal breaker, but this can be annoying depending on the layout of the 3.5 mm jack on your electronics. My only real complaint is that the cable for the individual phones (short for the left, but longer for the right) are thin, and feel fragile. I wouldn't expect them to hold up against a snag or any kind of abuse. I listen when sitting and walking and haven't had any problem with them, however.

Header: Very uncomfortable and cheap design, September 11, 2008
Comment:
I ordered these earbuds a few weeks ago, reluctantly--as I've been unimpressed with my previous experiences with asymetric earbud cords. These buds were no exception--in fact the short length of the cord made them even more uncomfortable than other asymetric cords I've tried in the past. The sound is decent (for this lowest tier cheap pricerange) but please don't allow yourself to be seduced by the price or by the Sennheiser name, these buds are crap. Every time you turn your head, a bud is painfully yanked from your ear by way of the cord uncomfortably gripping the back of your neck. Recently, I tried wearing them in front, which not only looks stupid, but, due to the inflexible cheap material they're made from, causes the cord to rub against my chin or cheek and still yanks the buds from my ears.

These headphones are by far the best bang for your ever shrinking dollar. They are snug and compact and block out surprising amounts of ambient noise. The only reason I didn't give them a five star rating is not as much bass response as I like, but that is expected for their size.

Comment:
Just wanted to address some of the low reviews. To have these ear buds sound good you *MUST* have a proper fit. When i first used these I also thought these were tinny sounding with no lows and no sound stage. After getting them to fit properly in the ear you will think you changed to a different pair of ear buds. Simply put, with a proper fit these sound great. Lows are strong but do not drown out mids or highs. voices are clear with a natural sound. Overall sound quality is excellent. A couple of cons include: Highs can be slightly harsh on some recordings. Also if cord is rubbing against something you can pick up sound. This can be eliminated by wearing the cord behind your head like the picture on the package shows and routing the cord so it is not flapping around. In conclusion these are a great set of buds for the price. Recommended. Also there are lots of fakes out there so be careful. Some of the reviewers may be listening to fakes.

Header: The buds need to be tight, February 29, 2008
Comment:
At first I wrote a real negative review about these but I have just realized I was wrong. I changed the size of the bud that goes in the ear to where it was a rather tight fit - and - problem solved. My opinion of these went from a 1 start out of 5 to a 5 out 5. To get the awesome sound that these ear buds offer you MUST have the right size bud in your ears. If there is any wiggle room for the buds when in your ear you will get terrible sound. I have a feeling this is where many of the negative posts have come from. I am telling you, once you get the ear buds nice and tight in your ear, you will get the high quality sound that the Sennheiser name is known for.

Header: Great sound ... one complaint., October 1, 2007
Comment:
The sound from these earbuds is really great. The in-ear design does a great job of filtering out ambient noise. Now, rather than turning the volume of my MP3 player all the way to 10, 5-7 is more than enough. Sound is good throughout the spectrum: the bass is responsive (even thunderous), the mids are clear and the highs aren't thin. The earbuds fit my ear very nicely. The soft rubber is snug and creates a "seal" that keeps out the sounds of the world. The package included three sizes of rubber buds; the ones in the middle were just right. My only complaint is that the rubberized cord creates its own noise. The springy cord is so well-integrated with the earbuds that cord movement creates noise that makes its way into the ear. Since I use the earbuds at the gym this creates a problem--the quiet parts of the music are filled with the strange, wiggling rumble of the moving rubber cord.

I reviewed various types of earbuds to replace the very uncomfortable ones that are factory supplied with ipods and other Mp3 devices until I finally settled on these and I can truthfully say I am extremely satisfied that I did. Great bass and tonal response across the music spectrum as well as a nice fit makes these a perfect replacement for many others as well as a bargain compared to the overpriced Bose earbuds.

Comment:
I read a lot of reviews before I bought these and I am still not sure what to expect in the long run. I see a lot of issues with the left channel going out after a few weeks so I will have to watch for that. I can also see how the people who wanted to used them for sports would be disappointed. For walking around and sitting they are fine, but I can see how they could come lose in more active usage. With that said, so far they are good for what I need so far. I ride the Metro in Moscow, Russia to work every day. The noise of the train is not pleasant and the noise from conversations and other peoples MP3 players being used at high volume is annoying. I was probably one of them before since I had to play my MP3 player at high volume to be able to hear anything over the background. With these headphones the background noise is significantly reduced and I can listen to, and hear my music at about half the volume of my old headphones. The sound and clarity is pretty good. The bass is a little muddy, but I didn't expect much from a woofer that is 1/8th of an inch across. The ear pieces fit comfortably, but since they fit so tightly they create sinus pressure to a small degree since the ear canals are connected to the sinus. If I equalize my ears the same way as for scuba diving by pinching my nose and then forcing air into it like I'm trying to blow will equalize the pressure in my ears and this helps somewhat. All in all I am happy so far.

Comment:
I keep thinking that maybe someone made a mistake and released this kind of quality in the mere mortal price range. I bought these together with Etymotic, and simply had to return the other one - after about a week, Etymotic just became the annoyance in comparison, and mind you their quality is pretty high too. On the matter of tonal fidelity, one needs to keep in mind that for a small thing like earbud headphones our own ears and environment play much more important role than for some big over the ears phones. So it was funny to read reviews from people complaining about the "missing" sound on both sides of the spectrum. While I won't claim to have the ears of Placido Domingo, I listen classical music say 90% of the time and at least for me there's no flaw I can report. This earbud it's as close to perfect as one can ever get. Oh, and one equally important thing - the ear adapters. While one can play with adapters from other phones, every time I tried the result was noticeably worse. Which is not to say that someone may not find a pair for some other phones that might be even better - but to warn that fora small earbud the silicone/rubber adapter matters too and that the adapter that you may consider the best in the universe may still reduce the sound quality on a non-native earbud.

Header: Awesome Headphones!!!, May 12, 2007
Comment:
Unlike most people, I don't use stock headphones, the ear buds don't stay in my ears well at all. So, I am stuck with some over the head ones and some clip-on ones. Well I wanted some noise muffling like headphones for the plane. Haven't had them on the plane yet but from my testing already they will do wonderfully. At first when you get them in they seem to let noise in but after playing music a bit for a minute then you get a good fit and all outside noise seems to drown away. Loud fans are low and distant, close small fans are non-existent and the computer is not even there as well. I can hardly hear my roommate when he is talking directly to me in slightly above normal voice (he is very loud normally). The nature of my job is that I use in the ear- ear plugs with Nrr33 all the time, I can't use anything lower than 30! This means that I am use to how these headphones feel and operate. Yes you will hear yourself breath and swallow, but it is not that bad. I can't even tell because I am used to it!!! These headphones have pretty close to my regular Nrr 33. I would say 20-25 depending on fit. They are not a substitute for proper hearing protectors in loud environments and in places that require your attention they can be dangerous. They don't annoy me, but take some time to find a proper fit, I thought I had it down and had to change now to both big and am happy. I had to go with both big ones probably due to the in the ear earplugs at work making my canals bigger. Sometimes you may have different sizes for each ear, everyone is different! The bass sounds awesome!!! The vocals and different instruments are clear, this is just as expected in Sennheiser quality. There wasn't that much of difference for me as I usually use my computer with a great soundcard and good headphones so the quality wasn't that different but still the number of extra things you hear with these phones is amazing. I can't believe what the stock people change is like, it must be euphoria! The left plug shorter cable (asymmetric) didn't bother me much at all and the cable doesn't make that much noise like other reviewers said. It is just like having ear plugs in. I will be glad to wear these on a plane. Jet noise is sort-of bad for your ears and these will take it down to tolerable levels and soon as you hit the music in it will probably be gone. Just keep the music low as these are louder than most headphones and any bit of hearing saved is good. I had my computer music on through 200+ watt speakers almost as loud (not recommended for long term hearing) as they would go and sitting in front of them with these on listening to mp3 player and could listen to my music in peace, the bass only interfered but not that much!!! These are an incredible value and will stay in nicely. Ditch the stock uncomfortable earbuds and pick up these in the ear headphones and re-appreciate your music again.

Comment:
I did alot of internet research before buying these earbuds. Yes, the different cord lengths were annoying at first, but it hasn't impacted my treadmill or outdoor running after a few months. These do isolate you from the outside world. My wife was yelling my name from upstairs as I was typing this and did not hear her at all. I am certainly no expert as to what constitutes good bass/treble levels vs. bad bass/treble levels. What I do know, is that the difference between these and the cheap iPod headphones is absolutely amazing. I thought I was downloading poor quality songs, but the songs I listen to sound tons better on these earbuds. I read another reviewer comment on the noise that comes through when the wires move and wouldn't recommend this product for runners. Yes, this does happen. But to be honest, when I'm running, I've tuned out that noise. I'm also conscious not to raise the volume of the music too high. Give this product a shot, even if you are an avid jogger.

Comment:
I can't believe how amazing these little earbuds are! I got them about 5 months ago and they have been fantastic. They do take a few weeks to get used to (if you've never used earbuds before), but it is worth it. It's such a crazy experience to use earbuds as good as these because when you put them in your ear, it sounds as if the music is in the middle of your head...it's very cool. The only problem I have with this is that the cord going from the center to the left ear is shorter than the one going to the right ear. I'm not really sure why manufacturers do this, but it is a little awkward sometimes. Additionally, even after 5 months, the cord is not perfectly straight...it still has fold marks from when I first bought it. These two negatives probably have to deal more with my OCD than an actual defect of the product....but the bottom line is that the sound quality, IMO, is amazing! The jump up from the Ipod earphones to these little bad-boys is quite impressive. I highly recommend!

These phones re-produce sound very well and remain faithful to high trebles and smooth bass. The idea of having one wire far longer than the other side is highly annoying. Indended to reach adolescents' lower pants' pockets, when normally used, hang down on one side of your neck and need to be wrapped. If you can get around this problem, the product does what it intends to do.

Header: Sennheiser quality....design could use improvement, February 20, 2007
Comment:
I have been a Sennheiser fan for sometime and these earbuds don't dissappoint when it comes to sound. They fit inside the ear canal with a choice of 3 different sized rubber hoods. The fit is critical for proper noise attenuation. They don't work well as workout headphones because they work their way out of the ear canal with movement and sweat...at least in my small ear canals. There is a learning curve placing them in the ear. The buds are small and almost round which makes them a bit difficult to get lined up in the ear canal. Also, I think that a small clothing clip would be a good addition to help prevent the occasional pull on the phone wire from dislodging the ear phones. Good sound however in a small package.

I love these in-the-canal earphones. I am on my 4th pair, but only because (all dog owners read this) my dog has this affinity for actually seeking these things out so he can eat them! When properly fitted they are great at noise occlusion and the sound is wonderful. Not too much bass and a balanced treble. The uneven length of the cord was curious at first, but just loop it in back of your neck and make sure the long length leads to your RIGHT ear. The only complaint I have (female readers can identify) is that having the phones stuffed into your ear canal for more than an hour or two begins to feel like a tampon that's been in there too long. (Sorry, but that's what it feels like!) It can get to be irritating, but maybe that's just my own ears. These are great. Keep them away from the dog.

I'll be brief here. If you are looking for an in-ear design that will absolutly redefine how you enjoy music, then BUY THESE NOW! I purchased these for a trip to San Diego, since airplane noise gives me a massive headache. I almost left these behind in the security bin, until my wife heard on the plane's PA that they found some earphones. As I thought, "who's that dummy", I quickly realized it was me! Ok, barely had to turn up my MP3 to get great sound from these little guys. Filtered out enough outside noise to make my 4-hour trip much more bareable, headache-free! As I got them home, I started using them since they sound better than any headphone I've listened with. Period.

These earbuds sound great and are well worth the $53 I paid for them. Make sure you use the right size ear adapters (they come in 3 sizes: S, M and L) according to the size of your ear canal to acheive optimal sound. Once you have the right size adapter and insert them all the way into your ear much like the way an ear plug fits, it sounds as if you are submerged in water. Outside noise becomes virtually inaudible. And once you crank your mp3 player you will hear nothing but the sweet sound of music. I ride the bus every morning to work so finding a pair of earbuds that could isolate noise was very important to me. With my old earbuds even with my iPod cranked high I could still hear annoying outside noise like people yapping on their cell phones, the a/c motor running, the bus' squeaky brakes. I could hear almost everything but my music. Now it's no longer an issue. Are there better sounding earbuds out there which provide deeper bass and better sound overall? I'm sure there are but none of them will be in the same price range as the CX-300's. You will not find a better sounding pair of earbuds for this price.

For the price, these are hard to beat. Sure there are better earbuds out there, but you will end up paying 2x - 3x (even 4x) times as much. From a Sansa 2gb mp3 player, these have good bass response (and I listen to a lot of bass-intensive beats), pretty clear highs, good fit (has replacable/customizale earbud pieces), good consturction (no wire sheathing problems yet).

These sound really good, bass is excellent, and the seal is good, but they are a little delicate. The driver units have separated from the plastic housing twice now. Some in ear units can just be snapped back into the plastic casing if they become separated, but these can't. At around $60-70 they should last longer than 4 months. I should add that sennheiser really does honour the 2 year warranty and have been excellent with regards to exchanging them.

Comment:
First off, I am not much of an audiophile. Or at least I wasn't until now. My boss recommended these to me based on his experience with Sannheiser (not this particular model though). After playing around with the different size bud covers, I plugged them into my 30gb iPod and was amazed by the clarity. In songs I've heard for years, I heard new sounds and parts I never heard before (probably because my car speakers are blown out). Tiny details like the breathing between lyrics, tapping of the drums, and the picking of guitars, come alive in these earbuds. The bass isn't great unless you press them firmly against your ears, which I don't recommend to do. However I mostly listen to rock, so deep bass isn't something I really need anyway. And now I laugh when I see the masses walking around with their standard issue white iPod earbuds (I regularly visit NYC and I'm astounded at how many people use bad earbuds). Seriously, just get these earbuds.

The sound and fit (in general) of these headphones is really good, especially for the price. Lots of good bass and clean mid-range. If you're going to use them for general use and light exercise, these are a good option. I, however, ran into problems w/ the headphones staying in while running. I tried all three earbud options, but couldn't find anything that wouldn't slip out. Also, the lanyard-style wire tends to pull one of the sides down a bit (as there's less slack on that side). So: general use / light exercise = great purchase Running / heavy cardio = you might want headphones w/ better grips around the ears.

Sound isolation: You can simply test its sound isolation without connecting the headphones to a mp3 player.

Sound: These are great. great treble with tight bass, although not as loud as the Koss but the Koss's bass is muffled. The CX300 is accurate.

I fly a lot, so I wanted some earphones that would reduce the airplane noise. First I got the Shure E2c since they were the most widely advertised. What a disaster -- I hard a very hard time getting them to fit in my ears, and when I finally did they were uncomfortable and the sound was pretty awful (very tinny). Then I got the V-Moda Vibe earphones and the Sennheiser CX-300. Both were much better in every way than the Shures -- better fit and better sound. Overall, the sound on the Sennheiser was slightly better (more bass) than the V-Moda. I also felt the Sennheiser did the best job of the 3 of blocking out the ambient noise. Add that to the fact they cost about half of the other 2, and the clear winner is the Sennheiser CX-300.

I bought these earbuds after narrowing it down to these and he sony 71's. The deciding factor for me was the color on these(silly i know). Man, am I glad i'm so shallow. I love these things. They are very slick looking with the black pod's, and the sound is better than I had anticipated. It does take some experimentation with the 3 different size rubber "things" to get the perfect sound for yourself though. Also the un-equal wires to each earbud are actually a great design, think about it, you wear the pod on one side or another so its always closer to that one ear. In summary, very sleek apperance, great sound, great design. Would buy again.

I can't recommend these headphones enough - the sound is crisp and the bass is amazing - its like listening to a pair of high quality tower speakers. I do recommend that you stick with the medium size fittings as they seem to offer the best bass. While the smaller fitting seemed to be easiest to fit in my ear - the cone was simply to small to put off the bass I wanted - and the large ones - well I haven't been able to fit them in so to try them. Still if your looking for a great quality set of headphones, these are the ones to get.

These stereo earbuds are awesome. The sound quality is excellent, and they are so comfortable, you could wear them all day. They also block outside noise very well, so I use them on airline flights and also when running the lawn tractor. I could not do that with my old style Sony earphones without risking hearing loss. The only negative is more of a personal preference than a problem. These phones are designed with the wire for the right ear bud longer than the other, so you drape the longer wire over your shoulder and behind your neck. I prefer the standard Y type. For this type of competitive price combined with the excellent sound quality, I will gladly get used to this feature.

I purchased these headphones for my Ipod Nano. I am very happy with them. They are a significant upgrade from previous headphones I have used in the past. What I like best about these earphones are the comfort and style. I read a lot of reviews on many different brands, I found that people had a lot of concerns about the comfort on these items. These earphones fit like a glove, also the length of the cord is a perfect fit, not too long and definately not to short. As far a sound goes, I guess I had different expectations. Since I was spending more than $10 for earphones, which is what I averaged in the past. The sound is good, but I guess I expected a little more. I would recommend these earphones, they are a great value for $60 or less.

i used to have the sony headphones that are exactly like this and ive always had problems with headphones so i decided to finally just get really nice headphones and these are amazing. the sound is so clear weather your listening to acustic, rock or rap. i read other review saying that the bass isnt strong enough but i figured out taht if you dont have the headphones all the way in its not that stong of a bass but if u push them into your ears so that they are still comfortable and all the way in the bass is what makes the headphones. i love these and i and completly satisfied with them.

What's up, I can't run with these because my footsteps shake the buds out of my ears and the buds are like 'okay' and just fall out and I wind up looking like a stupid dick running like a tool with these flappy pieces of plastic attached to my shorts. They're ok if I'm just in my bed staring at the ceiling though.

Header: background hum and repeated failures, February 22, 2009
Comment:
I've purchased this item twice and had exactly the same problems both times. First, I had a constant background hum/buzz when using with either my Sony Walkman mp3 player or computer. It wasn't significant and generally not a problem, except during soft passages. Second, after a few months of use, I've experienced sudden and significant loss of volume in the left earpiece. Again, this has happened TWICE (I thought the first occurance was just bad luck on my part), in spite of very gentle treatment of the cords. Overall, I'm very disappointed, since my Sennheiser headphones are great.

Header: Sennheiser CX300-W Earbuds, December 22, 2008
Comment:
These earbuds have good sound quality when standing still. The disappointment is that when the wires rub against anything, this noise is also transmitted. This noise is noticeably louder than the standard ipod earphones. Perhaps, this is a complaint against all earbuds and I should have opted for the bulky headphones.

Header: Great Sound and Quality At A Relatively Low Cost!!, December 30, 2007
Comment:
I wanted a decent pair of earbuds for my Apple 8 GB iPod touch, but didn't want to pay a high price for them. Sennheiser came through with flying colors. The CX300-B earbuds are comfortable and provide a nice crisp sound in the high-frequency range with a VERY respectable bass response. If you're a true audiophile and have the money, you should buy one of the more expensive sets of earbuds from Shure or Etymotic. But, if you're like me and want a decent set of headphones with a respectable frequency response (range and accuracy) that you aren't afraid to carry around with you while traveling, these are perfect. A very good selection for most people.

I have central auditory processing disorder, which (basically) means that I can't filter out noise in the background. Since I work in an open office environment, my work productivity and quality was declining because I could not focus and concentrate. Then I got these headphones. They are awesome! They filter out ambient noise, and the sound quality is amazing. If you're using the headphones that came with your iPod, switch them out for a pair of sennheisers.

Header: The best fitting earbuds for me, September 11, 2007
Comment:
I won't get into a discussion of the quality of the sound of these headphones, discussing the highs and lows, etc. Sound is very subjective and what sounds good to me might sound dull and muddy to someone else. My biggest conern with headphones is the fit. I have used inner-ear canal headphones as well as a veriety of foam-covered earbuds. Very few headphones I have tried will fit my ears. With other headsets, such as Sony, Shure, Ultimate Ears, etc, they always seem to fall out of my ears if I turn my head. Even if I use the largest rubber flange, they never seem to fit. Ok, I think I have big inner ears. I have been very frustrated trying to find headphones that have tips large enough to fit my ears... because after all, the quality of sound is as much about fit as anything else. With these Sennheiser CX300's, I FINALLY found a rubber tip that fits (and STAYS) in my ears! Of course, I need to use the largest size rubber flange, but the size, combined with the light weight of the tips, create a perfect fit. I can finally exercise without the earbuds falling out. Oh yeah, and the sound is great too. They have much more bass than the Shure's had, but my Sony's always had TOO MUCH bass. These are somewhere in between. A very nice balance of sound. One small complaint I have is that the tip of the earbud has a flexible "handle" (where the earbud joins the cord), and it is difficult to get a hold of the earbud while it is in my ear, to adjust the fit. This is a very MINOR gripe. They are the best headphones I have ever used.

For a while now I have been looking for a ear bud type headphones that would allow me to listen to a variety of music, on my ipod, without the outside world coming into play. I brought these after looking at reviews on Amazon, and I'm glad I did. The sound coming from my ipod is bassy(as I like it) and the outside world is shut out.Perfect for using on the tube system here in London. I can also turn down the volume, and still enjoy the same great sound experience. In fact, so good are these bad boys, that I am loathe to use them on the street, as I can't hear footsteps approching. Great product

Header: Better than Shure E2c, November 18, 2006
Comment:
I own these and the Shure E2 and these are way better. The bass is 10 times louder and deeper than the Shures. These have way more range and are more comfortable. At first I didn't like these but I realized you really have to shove them in your ear. It feels a little penetrating but after a while it feels good:) My only real complaint is that the cord length is WAY to short. I have to buy an extension and that may impact the sound. The wire is also really thin and it is loud when rubbing against your clothes (or skin).

Comment:
These earphones provide the clear, flat sound typical of Sennheiser's other monitors. I listen primarily to classical (orchestral, chamber music and piano) and jazz. Midrange instruments (violas, horns, clarinets) come through with more detail than I often hear. The earphones have no trouble handling low frequencies, even at hefty volumes (pedal notes in Bach organ music, and electric/acoustic bass in jazz ensembles and big band)--they're deep, rich and spacious. High frequencies are clear and not the least bit strident. I've used these with an iAudio X5 mp3 player on airplanes, trains and buses and because they're somewhat "isolating", am able to listen at moderate volumes without losing any detail. They're comfortable enough for me to fall asleep at night listening to music. Are they durable? Remains to be seen...I've had them for one month.

Comment:
I have had a pair of these since December 06 (5 months) and was extremely happy with them. Recommended them to a colleague at work who purchased a pair last month and she was also very impressed with them and intended to buy more to give to relatives for gifts. From last week, the sound level from the right hand bud reduced such that it was barely audible even at full volume rendering them unusable. This week exactly the same thing happened to my colleague's pair. Unfortunately neither of us kept our receipts. The Sennheiser web site indicates that the warranty period is 2 years however a purchase receipt is required. E-mailed the Australian distributor and was told no receipt/no warranty (even though the product hasn't been on the market for 2 years). All up we wasted $160 and Sennheiser have lost 2 people who will never buy or recommend their products again when a lot of goodwill would have been generated by agreeing to replace them. If you are going to buy these, make sure you keep your receipt or better still save $50 and buy Creative EP 630s instead - other than the cord (which is equal length right and left)they look identical and sound the same or possibly a little less bright.

Hi I bought these headphones about a year ago and while the sound, comfort, and tech of the headphones has been great the durability has been a problem. These headphones did everything that you expect out of a Sennheiser product in terms of sound quality but the within the first couple of months they started splitting down the center cord. A year later the center cord is now two cords and the left ear has stopped working. It was amazing in its time but unfortunately it is time to buy something new.

Header: Chance of Counterfeit / Poorly Handled, September 27, 2010
Comment:
My first impression of these canals were the STATIC/noise/hiss! It was faint but noticeable. The interesting thing was that the hiss was constant, no matter if I mute the volume or max it out. In other words the hiss did not get worse or better depending on the volume. I contacted Sennheiser and checked on numerous online forums. Sennheiser said that the sellers on Amazon are on their NON-AUTHORIZED sellers: [...] [...] This is what they told me: "Non-authorized dealers selling "legit" product have no relationship with Sennheiser. They may get their goods from a source that is questionable; perhaps they are stolen, returned, refurbished (even though they say they are new), new, old, counterfeit...we have no idea. They may not have been stored in the proper environment (were they in a truck for an entire winter with no heat?) and thus we cannot guarantee the product to perform as it would when going through the appropriate supply chain." And their 2 year WARRANTY WILL NOT COVER you. The model CX 300 is especially easy to counterfeit judging from the simplicity in design. Even if they are real the quality may have dropped since Sennheiser has not manufactured them for a couple of years now. A friend of mine who is a musician say that there is a clear distortion when the volume is increased. And the number of other pairs of headphones I tested do not create the hissing sound. I bought a pair of CX 280 for double the price from a legit store and the difference in quality (in terms of build and the hiss) is stark. What I think is that the ones I bought were probably legit but the quality dropped significantly. Bottom line: Be careful even when buying from Amazon!!!

Bought these for running -- regret it now. They significantly amplify the "whistle" from wind. Cord bouncing also produces a very noticeable clicking noise. They also do not stay in my ear as well as my last ear buds, but that could be just me. Sound quality is good as long as you're relatively still and not outside. I absolutely hate the asymmetrical cord -- real PITA -- doesn't hang down naturally and pulls to one side. Regular ol' Y style cable seems to work best when active.

These earbuds aren't bad at all and really nice for average buds and for the price. I bought em couple years ago and I still use them... because they still work unlike some other ones. Straight 2.0 jacks never works for me cause they always get damages the way I use them but this has L shaped jack and it works perfect for me and the joints and the wire itself is very flexible so they don't break down easily. Only thing I personally didn't like was the the length difference.

I got these because my old $25 Sony Fontopia buds seemed to be on their last leg after about 5 years of daily use. I was pretty optimistic about these, because they've gotten decent reviews and because I have some excellent sennheiser headphones for my computer. I got them and tested them out, and the sound quality was good! It was about the same as the Sony's, maybe a little bit better, but not as good external noise cancellation. I used them for a few days happily, the only problem being this clicking noise on the right one whenever I pushed it into my ear (small noise, by sharp and not comfortable when its right next to your eardrum.) Then the bads started coming. I noticed quickly that the cord was a bit short. Some of my pants have fairly deep pockets, and the cord would stretch to its length in them. I'm about 6'0, so about average guy height. The cord just needs to be about 2" longer. Then, I was walking into a room, and the cord got caught on the door handle and pulled a bit. It didnt even pull them hard enough to loosen them from my ears or my mp3 player. I have done this dozens of times with the Sony buds, much harder as well... no problems. These Sennheisers immediately messed up, though. The sound goes in and out with the slightest movement, so I have to constantly hold the cord in a very exact position if I want my music to be more than a whisper. Not really acceptable, even for a cheap pair of buds. Maybe mine are defective, but I have to say they are by FAR the least durable buds I have ever had, including extremely cheap free ones. So, sound quality is good. Durability is beyond awful. Again, maybe just defective, but not acceptable.

Header: Good stuff - the original, August 24, 2010
Comment:
I started out with Apple ipod original earbuds. They lasted a long time, but since I'm a heavy user, they eventually wore out. The improvement from regular earbuds to in-ear earbuds was much larger than I anticipated. External sound isolation, sound response and all measurable quality is so much better with in ear earbuds. Before coming to the trusty CX300's, I tried two sets of a Koss popular model, but they tended to wear out in a few months. Then I arrived at these and there was a significant uptick in sound quality as well as durability. Some of the best earbuds I've ever owned. I eventually switched because of a move from the original iPod Nano to the iPhone (Apple, in their infinite design wisdom, started requiring nonstandard plugs), because these no longer fit. If you're a heavy user, be aware that these originals are significantly better than the new CX200 (II?), CX300 II's as well as the CX500. I've tried all of them (even several of some models) over the last 11 months. The sound quality is still great, but the main failure with all of them is the weakness of the phone connector - it just breaks down within weeks or months. I'm at a location where it's difficult to deal with warranty, so I've usually just bought new ones and it's become very expensive. I just ordered a set of Klipsch IMAGE S4 (several times the price of these) based on the CNET review. Recommendation? Unless you're using an iPhone, go with these - you won't regret it. If you are using the iPhone, look elsewhere.

Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds produce a great, rich sound while drowning out the rest of the world. They isolate what you want to hear and do it well. They have great bass response and they last for a long time. They come with 3 sizes of earbud replacements which is nice. The only thing I don't like about them is that one cord is shorter than the other for around the neck use. Just not a fan of it. Great headphones for the price though.

The lop-sided cord, longer on the right than on the left, is a major defect in the design of this product. Other than that defect, the sound quality is very good for the price range. The lop-sided cord results in the left ear-bud being pulled out of my ear all too often, which has resulted in premature wear of the left, rubber ear-piece which will have to be replaced at a frequency of at least twice the right.

I bought these for my mother since her old Sansa headphones kept falling out of her ears. Since she goes outside a lot, I thought moderately priced headphones should do the trick as long as they provide sound isolation. This is good bang for the buck. Pros -The design is pretty cool (a little gimmicky, but different) -The bass can be overpowering at times, but it's pretty great with Hip-Hop/Pop/Rock music. -The buds are VERY comfortable Cons -The mids and lows are a little washed out but it won't be enough for you to throw these away -The cord quality concerns me because it isn't really durable (so buyer beware) -The cord should be a tad longer All in all, good product especially for the price. Highly recommended for people that workout a lot like my mom.

I'm not an expert professional DJ or anything that needs top notch perfect sound, but these earbuds are great. I bought these almost 2 years ago. I use them when I'm walking to class, working out, and when I want to block some outside noise. These aren't the best noise canceling earbuds I've tried, but they're good enough to the point where I can't hear it when people are having a casual conversation nearby. As far as the build of the earbuds, they're very durable. Like I said before, I use them pretty often. These are also the only earbuds that actually feel comfy in my ears. The only problem I get sometimes is that if you plan on working out with these (and you sweat a lot), the buds can actually slip out pretty easily which can get annoying. Also, the cord can be a little noisy when rubbed against clothing etc., but it's minimal and you don't really notice it unless you have your music on really low. The cord is uneven so you can put it behind your neck and keep it out of your way. I find that useful when I'm working out. The bass and sound quality are fantastic when used with the right device. I use these mostly with my ipod. Sometimes on other mp3 players or devices, I don't get the same quality... For instance, when I use my laptop, I sometimes have to adjust the equalizer on my media player. Acoustics and treble sound incredible. The range of these buds are awesome for what I listen to. Just to give an idea, I listen to a lot of Jack Johnson, Pop, Hip-Hop, Classical and Jazz music. I find that Acoustic, Jazz, and Classical music sound the best on these (not saying that the pop and hip-hop music sound bad) but it's just that you can really hear the clarity between the different instruments. When it comes to Pop, and Hip Hop, if you like bass, these are pretty powerful. You hear a lot of clarity, but not as good with Jazz or Classical music. Also, if you like increasing the bass through an equalizer, you might experience some distortion (but then again, this could happen to any headphone). Overall for under $30, these are high quality. I own Sennheiser and Shure over the head earphones that I think sound better than these earbuds (but then again it's not fair to compare earbuds to over the head earphones). Plus I sometimes think it's a little obnoxious when you have huge headphones on when you're just casually walkin' around town. I bought these on Amazon for $23ish so I know they are legit since Amazon is authorized to sell Sennheiser products. Watch out for other online vendors who sell fake Sennheiser products for cheap!! My roomie bought a pair from an eBay seller for like $12 and they were crappy quality. They were made out of cheap plastic, the sound sucked, and the left bud blew out in only 2 weeks! The Sennheiser logo also faded after I gently rubbed on it. After all the sweat and use that I have put my earbuds through, they work perfectly fine and the logo has not faded one bit. I highly recommend this for the average user who isn't too picky with their earbuds, and those who want quality sound for a good price.

Header: Excellent sound - poor durability, July 10, 2010
Comment:
I have owned two pair. First pair: one ear bud died after about 4 months of daily use, I mean, spontaneously died. Like, I was listening, and the sound in one ear just went away and never came back. This made me mad, but I really liked the sound, so I ordered another pair. Again, used every day while I work, lasted about 6 months, one side died. I continued to stay optimistic and said, "That's okay, I need one ear free anyway so I can hear any calls from work." Six months or so later, after being content w/one ear bud, that ear bud died. It is quite disgusting. Again, the sound is outstanding, but is not worth much if they are going to die after a year at best. So I am moving on to JLABS which have similar testimonies to this, but at least there is a semblance of customer support as people such as I myself testify to their negative experiences.

The sound is without doubt very good and will be a step up from most MP3 player's standard headphones. However the product quality leaves much to be desired, especially when one considers the Sennheiser brand stresses quality. The left earbud stopped working within a year and, as others have pointed out, the in ear fit leaves much to be desired. I find myself constantly fiddling with the buds to ensure a good fit. They are worth buying for sound quality alone, but expect to have to replace them fairly frequently. I suppose that's why they are priced as they are. Still I would expect better from a company like Sennheiser.

Header: Good value and great sound quality for their size, but needs foam tips, May 12, 2010
Comment:
I bought these a couple years ago, after several review searches for ~$30 in-ear 'phones, and have used them when listening to my iPod in bed, on airplanes and when walking. No durability problems at all. They compare surprisingly well for sound with my Sennheiser HD435 and Bose QC2 noise canceling 'phones. The sound quality is very good with excellent clarity and range. The passive noise-canceling works pretty well for airplane travel and saved me carrying my bulky Bose QC2 'phones on short haul flights. Listening to podcasts of the nightly news is no problem on a plane and the volume setting is not much more than when I'm in a quiet room. However, I have always had some trouble with the silicone tips, particularly my left ear. For some reason, the left bud doesn't fit well in my ear canal even with the small silicone tip which suits me best, compared with the medium or large silicone tips. After a while, it seems to work loose and is less comfortable than the right side. Either side, I am occasionally pushing them in to maintain the seal. Today, I received a 3-pair set of medium-size Comply T400 foam tips, ordered from [...] (sorry Amazon!). They work just great! The memory foam is very comfortable and the buds hold nicely in both ears, providing a better seal. In fact, while writing this, I accidentally pulled away from my iPod and the connector pulled out of the iPod, but the left bud that took most of the tension stayed in! I can hardly feel them in my ears now as well. The sound quality is better too with the improved isolation; the bass is stronger. Unfortunately, the cost of the tips is ridiculously high at about $16 (shipped) for a pair of 3. I understand each pair has a life of maybe 3 months with normal use (whatever that means), less with heavy use. I will monitor and report back. However, this may be a price I have to pay for the improved fit. :-(

Header: Good quality sound for the price, but design is an issue, May 10, 2010
Comment:
When I can get the earbuds in my ear, the sound quality is good enough for me. Deep bass and ok highs and mids. The main problem I have with these earbuds is the cord. The right side is longer than the left side, which is really annoying for me as when I'm walking, my hand has a tendency to swipe the cord back and it pulls my left earbud out of my ear and it's a constant struggle to keep putting it back in. I have read online that they designed the cords this way to wear it around your neck, but when the wind blows the cord, or when I turn my head, one of the earbuds will pop out. It's really annoying as I spend most of my time adjusting the earbuds in my ear rather than listening to the music. I tried all three sizes of the earbuds they gave me and they all had the same problem. I can't jam the earbuds any further in my ear to make them more secure, so I guess you get what you pay for with this product.

Header: Not impressed compared to the old MX400, May 8, 2010
Comment:
Bought these as a potential replacement for the MX400, which I love but are now discontinued. I don't find the sound quality to be nearly as good as the MX400, which had wonderful detail in the bass and were smooth over most of the spectrum. By comparison, the bass on the CX300 is weak, indistinct and underdamped, and the highs aren't crisp. The sound quality also varies as the CX300 is **VERY** sensitive to exactly how they are positioned in the ear. Note the cord design with a shorter cord for the left side than the right. Equal lengths have the advantage that they divide any pulling stress equally between the ear. But with the CX300 design a small tug pulls them out of my left ear every time. On the plus side, they're quite comfortable in my ear and I can wear them for long stretches without discomfort. They were cheap enough that I don't regret my purchase too much. Guess I'll have to keep looking for good, not-too-expensive earphones.

Comment:
I had high expectations for these earbuds, but to be honest, I get better sound with my stock iPod earbuds equipped with Griffin Earjams. The sound on the Sennheiser buds is tinny with almost no bass, unless you jam the bud so far into your ear canal that it's about touching your brain. Also they have asymmetric cord lengths, so the right cord is much longer than the left one. It's weird if you're used to the standard setup with both sides the same length.

Comment:
I've owned these headphones for 4 years now, before they finally stopped working (because of my clumsiness) and throughout that time, they've always been compact, sturdy and have provided excellent sound and bass (I'm a club dance/technophile) you can expect from a company like Sennheiser. The only thing I wish these had was a thicker cord, something similar to iPod headphone cords, but otherwise, the behind-the-neck design, sound quality and affordability of this pair makes me come back for another after having broken my first pair.

Comment:
After getting an iPod Touch a few months ago, I had noticed how much better the sound was than on my MS Zune. I have had Zunes for a couple of years and have their "premium" IE headphones. I was using the Zune headphones on the iPod and really enjoyed the clarity of the sound, but I began to wonder if changing up my headphones would allow me to experience even better sound. Being a former musician (bass player) I wanted better low end. After searching and reading reviews for about a month I finally decided to try some relatively inexpensive phones and selected the Sennheiser CX-300. After receiving them 3 days after ordering (fast service) I tried them out, they seemed to have almost too much bass at first compared to the Zune. After burning them in for about a day and using them all week I'm very pleased with them. My ears have become accustomed to the sound and now the bass seems just right, the Zune phones now sound very thin in comparison. My ratings; Sound quality; 5 stars. Excellent IMO. Comfort; 5 stars. Using the largest earpieces I got the most comfortable fit and best sound (btw, I tried the same earpieces on the Zune phones, made them more comfortable but not better sound. They are small enough to wear in bed and lay your head on it's side and not feel them getting pushed harder into the ear. Cord length; 4 stars, just a bit short, but no problems. Value for money; 5 stars. You can spend allot more and not get much better sound. Durability; 4 stars. A bit subjective at this point. Build quality, cord seems very light compared to the Zune which has a cloth covered cord. Stylishness; 5 stars. Very small and unobtrusive. I don't want neon colored headphones! Item Design; 4 stars. Took one off because of the very light cord. Packaging; 4 stars. Not much to say except they came in one of those plastic sealed packages that's almost impossible to open without cutting the ends or sides apart to tear it open. External Sound Isolation; 5 stars. I sleep with them on partially to cut out external noise. They do an excellent job here. I would have given them 5 stars over all except for the cord. I'm hoping it's durable and will last. My only other concern is they look ALMOST identical to the Creative EP-630 which sell for a bit less. I'd like to be able to do a direct comparison some day. Overall, worth the money if you want noise isolating decent sounding IE phones.

Comment:
I got these to replace an older model of Sennheiser earbuds that wore out at the plug. So far, they've been excellent. While the sound isn't as bass-heavy as my old CX-300, the plug now a solid, one-piece design so hopefully I'll get more mileage out of these. I'm a fairly lanky fellow but even so the cord's long enough to go from pockets to ears and still have a bit of slack. These also have good sound isolation from the rubber earbuds and if you're having trouble you can try the larger and smaller sizes that come shipped with it. My biggest complaints are the plug sometimes coming a bit loose during strenuous exercise and the fact it arrived in clamshell packaging. Goddamn clamshell packaging.

Header: Compared to Shure e2c, March 22, 2010
Comment:
So I owned the Shure e2c for a couple years (even bought my girlfriend some Shure e2c's as a gift), even replacing them twice when one side would just stop working. Shure was really good about this. It's been a bit of time now and the cord of the Shure's suddenly broke and within a week they stopped working. So I did some searching, found out Shure e2c's aren't made anymore, that ppl don't like the updated version as much, and thought I'd try these b/c they're much cheaper. Now, I primarily use my headphones at the gym, primarily lifting, but very sweaty. I also use them with public transportation: subways, planes, cars, trains, etc. Compared to Shure e2c: -Sound quality/sound isolation: I will start by saying that I'm not one of the expert sound technicians with bat hearing and sonar. I'm pretty sure they're full of crap and I would say the Placebo effect is not only for medications. I would say that when the Shures are fit properly, they are amazing at blocking external sounds and the music sounds great. However, especially at the gym and when sweaty, they can easily pop out and the quality/isolation goes from 9 to a 5/10. The Sennheisers are more like a 7/10, but they're much easier to keep in your ears (even with sweat) and so much less annoying and overall easier to keep pretty good sound quality. I think the bass and treble and all that are pretty good with both. For me, I think the main reason the Shures sound better is b/c they get better isolation with a good seal - which can be difficult to keep. -Comfort: I think the Sennheisers are MUCH more comfortable and also much easier to keep in your ears and sealed. -Cord: Shures cord is much thicker and stiffer. It did well until in the end it just frayed. Sennheiser's is much thinner and more squirrely. I will say, I HATE THE DESIGN of the Sennheiser. I'm pretty sure I'm not smart enough to figure it out. The Shure divide b/t the left and right at the base. The Sennheiser have a really long left cord and short right cord. I can't figure out how this could ever be useful. I've even tried to search on the internet, but failed. It leaves a whole bunch of extra cord dangling from my left ear around my neck. I'm probably going to tie it together to be like the Shure (and every other set of earphones I've ever seen). I will repeat that I really hate this design. If you can help me, please let me know. Also, they are pretty susceptible to static and the sound going in and out with both ears when the cord is moved at the input to my ipod. The Shure were better in this way. (however, on two separate pairs of Shures, one side just stopped producing sound - which they nicely replaced without a fight). Overall, I think they're great for the price. Good sound, decent isolation, comfortable. But, really hate the cord design - doesn't interfere with the sound, just annoys the crap out of me.

Comment:
I am very pleased with the sound quality, but I am not an audiophile and think its ridiculous to compare the sound quality of earbutds with expensive speakers. I would advise anyone not to use the cheap earbuds that come with the iPod. They are uncomfortable and the sound quality is average. The CX300 cord is a little on the short side for those who are 6' tall and over. I feel the wires are delicate, so I can't vouch for the durability. The earpieces are quite comfortable. Overall I feel I got these at a great price and that they really do improve the sound. I listen to classical music a lot and the sound resolution is very nice. I would highly recommend these earbuds.

Header: comfortable, great for "mismatched" ears, March 7, 2010
Comment:
I'm a medical transcriptionist and need good headphones to hear voice files for transcription. Because my ears are "lopsided", I have avoided earbuds and similar headphones for years. My right ear just isn't as big as my left. Apparently, I'm not very symmetric. But many over-ear types of headphones make my ears itch after a while, and since I wear headphones 8-10 hours a day, I need something comfortable. It was with the mismatched ear issue in mind that I tried these headphones, and I am so glad I did. The small size fits great in my right ear, the medium in my left, and overall this is a very comfortable set of headphones. They are durable and the cloth covers over the headphones are easy to take on and off and clean. The cord length is pretty good, although I wish it was just a little longer, just a couple of inches. The sound on music and video was terrific for the price point, but my equalizer and sound card output settings did require quite a bit of tweaking to get good sound on the voice-only files I listen to. Eventually, I achieved a really good balance and these headphones work great for transcribing, too. I don't need sound cancellation on my headphones, but they do provide quite a bit of insulation from outside sound (and to keep others from hearing what you are listening to). You can put the buds in your ears so that it almost creates a vacuum seal, or you can gently adjust them so they sit comfortably but don't make as tight a seal. I discovered that was very handy this week when I had a cold and had ears popping all day.

With all the great reviews here, I thought I was getting a great set of earbuds, not so. Sure you can get alot of bass through them...if you shove them into your brain. I tried all 3 sizes of plugs and none of them allowed me to hear the bass. However, once the earbuds are fully inserted into yours ears and you press REALLY hard on them you can hear the bass. But tell me, who is going to hold their hands to their ears while listening to music. Nobody! The only thing I fould positive about these was that they did indeed block out outside sounds. When one considers the money spent on this versus the improvement of sound over the standard Ipod headphones it is a complete and total waste of money.

The best thing about these headphones is that they include three different sizes of rubber attachments, which makes it easy to ensure they fit snugly in your ear and will not fall out without a sturdy yank. The attractiveness of this feature increases tenfold when you are attempting to listen to earbuds under a winter hat. The value for the money is amazing. I would have paid more for these and still been pleased. The only thing I cannot speak to is the durability, but that is only because I have had these headphones for only a couple of weeks.

My priorities in earbuds are in sound quality and comfort. I have rather narrow ear canals, and it can be difficult to find products that fit well. These are great. I can't attest to the durability and lasting quality as I have literally had these in for five minutes; however, I'm a repeat buyer of Sennheiser products because of the fact that they are quite capable of enduring my abuse. You really can't beat the sound quality at the price. The clarity is not perfect but remarkable, and bass levels and clarity leave little to be desired. I'm not exactly an audiophile, but I do dislike listening to music at a subpar level. These earbuds get the job done at an enviable price. The five stars is based on value.

Header: Great upgrade from "free" earbuds, December 28, 2009
Comment:
I bought these earbuds as an upgrade from the ones that came with my SanDisk Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black). These are a huge improvement. The sound quality is great. The cord is thinner and more flexible (albeit a little longer than I'd like). The earbuds are the kind that fit inside the ear canal. This means they can be a little less comfortable in some ways but they also provide a great deal of sound isolation. It's like getting noise-cancelling earbuds without the extra cost. I also upgraded my Sansa to RockBox so I could play OGG and FLAC files. With these earbuds, you can hear the difference between low-bitrate MP3s. While I haven't been able to detect the difference between a 320Kbps MP3 and either OGG or FLAC, I'm sure it's in there somewhere.

Header: From Ace Photo Digital these are NOT fake. Sound great, good value online., December 21, 2009
Comment:
I just received my order from Ace Photo Digital for both a Sennheiser CX300 and a CX300 II, both are high quality earbuds, especially for the price! Soon AFTER I ordered them I was concerned when I saw all the web sites describing "fakes" that are sold on eBay and even on Amazon.com. Well, after looking at about 10 websites with pictures comparing fake to real, I am convinced these are real. And email correspondence from APD was timely [...] and they told me "Not to worry, no fakes here. We buy directly from Sennheiser." I believe them. The shipping worried me but it turned out the Postal Service never scanned in at any location, so no tracking at all and I wasn't sure they were coming but they did. So all is well with this supplier and they are not fake (see my reasons below). The point is that when I ordered the 300 buds, Ace Photo Digital is NOT the first supplier that comes up on the list to order from, so by default they would have come from somewhere else. I can't speak for the quality from the "first" supplier but people are complaining their's are fake and I assume they are from the first supplier and not APD. No of course I don't work for APD and never heard of them before, but it is good information to find a supplier you can trust as not everything on Amazon is the same apparently, so I give credit where it is due and hope it helps you! Also I noticed that some other reviews are VERY old and I'm not so sure which item they are reviewing anymore - things change a lot since 2006, even what Sennheiser ships may have changed! On to the 2 Sennheiser earbuds features... I already knew I wanted earbuds and I picked these for 2 reasons: price/performance/value and physical size. In my local trusted HiFi store I asked what is the sweet spot for price/performance and then followed up online by reading reviews. The other reason is I want earbuds and I don't want them to stick out too far like the older high end Shure ones used to at least. The store said the SkullCandy ones are maybe tolerable for the price (maybe 10 dollars online), and the best higher priced ones were the Sennheiser (I forgot the model) and Dr. Dre and Sure, but the sweet spot were these Sennheiser's. I don't know about the other Senn models in comparison but I like the price of the 300's. Obviously anything sounds 10x better and is more comfortable than the junk that ships with most cheap MP3 players, that is a given. But these are as great as I would expect from Sennheiser, a great company. Both the 300 and 300 II sound great to me and I am comparing them to about 5 sets of good earbuds in the last 25 years. They have come a long ways, especially the noise isolation style nowadays... These Senn's are a type called "noise isolation" (blocks the noise by sealing in the ear canal very well, as opposed to actively changing the sound electronically like "noise cancelling" types). I like this style for airplane traveling on long overseas flights, and for wearing on a motorcycle. Sure the active noise cancellation style works better but the good ones are not earbuds and don't fit into your pants pocket when you get off the plane and travel in a taxi, car, bicycle, on foot, etc. The fact that they don't stick out away from the ear very far is great for: resting/sleeping with your ear on a pillow, fitting under a full motorcycle helmet (not legal in some states), or with no helmet on they minimize wind noise hitting them if you at least have a basic windshield on your bike. The other HiFi earbuds I use that are similar are from around 2004 and are Etymotic ER6 (now replaced by ER6i) but I paid over $120 for them. I haven't compared the sound yet but I think the Senn's are louder (more efficient) than the ER6 which is a problem on a motorcycle, the ER6 would not go loud enough as they are very inefficient. The ER6 also have very thin wire which is always getting tangled when I put them on. The ear canal silicone like part has 2 pieces and over time it itches my ear at the seam between the two. I haven't worn the 300's for long yet but they don't feel as tight and I think they will stay in but be more comfortable for long periods of time. Why I think these are not fake: Main things that convinced me were: the 300 had plastic packaging with a lot sticker inside it on the bottom, the shape of the black plastic and screen over the driver itself (remove the ear canal covers to see this), the position and shape of the aluminum colored housing, the plug (which is large and gold on the 300 II), the type of wire. Only the 300 II comes with a black carrying pouch, and one website showed it inside and out with fabric, stitching, size of Sennheiser lettering, all of which convinced me this one is real. A pouch is handy. Comparison between 300 and 300 II: I personally can't tell a difference in sound quality. I'm not saying they are the same but to me they are both great. You can bump up the bass of the source and it can really crank it out, and the highs are crisp, on both of them. Like I said the 300 II comes with a soft case but the 300 doesn't. You can always find something like a small ziplock baggie (go to Ace hardware in the loose nuts and bolts section and ask for small ones!). One thing I do not like about the 300 II is that it has an oversized L-shaped plug, which would be fine except it sticks out so far from my little tiny MP3 player that it is a bit cumbersome and I am a bit afraid it acts like a lever and if it got hit it could damage the jack on the player or at the very least crack it or make the connections intermittent. For that reason I like the 300 better than the 300 II overall. Also APD was currently shipping the 300 II in an "ECO" box which is a weird thick stocky cardboard container (like a old box of floppy disks but smaller) made up of like 10 slats of cardboard with all the pieces buried inside it. Weird but hey the contents are the same and it is green (if you recycle). Perhaps someone can comment whether this makes it even more proof that it is not fake, as I would guess this is some kind of brand new container that our pacific rim friends have not yet copied (perhaps?? dunno). One more thing, like another reviewer made me aware of, the cable is asymmetrical which at first I did not like but now I do: You are supposed to put your MP3 player on your left side to the left earbud, then the longer cable to the right earbud should go BEHIND your neck, not under your chin. In this way it does not dangle and pull down and is also out of the way. If you have long hair you can almost hide them completely! P.S. These were selling for 29 and 33 dollars for the 300 and 300 II, which is truly a bargain, less than half of that in my local HiFi store.

My old Sony earbuds, which I bought 3 years ago from Fry's for roughly $55, died on me unexpectedly. They were good and lasted awhile despite my horrible abuse, but alas...they couldn't handle it anymore. So that led me to purchasing these babies. Since I'm on a tight budget, I decided to spend less and found that this pair of buds had favorable ratings in general, so I ordered them. It's been a month or so and I'd have to say I'm fairly satisfied. I can barely tell the difference from my old pair, and they only cost less than half. The bass is good, and they're quite comfortable - I also like the varying sizes of rubber buds. This would have been a steal if the earbuds had come with a clip of some sort, as I use these during my job and I move around a lot. The headphones sometimes get a little loose if I make a quick movement and the wire sometimes gets tangled. But that's all fairly minor, when weighing the positive attributes of this product in.

Comment:
The previous pair I owned were put through workouts at the gym, taken into the sauna, stuffed into my backpack for flights, caught on the stairs and pulled out of my ears as I ran up the stairs, and have never ever failed. The bass is deep, the buds fit all ear canals as they come with every size and Sennheiser is a high quality headphone maker so you cannot possibly go wrong there either. The cons... well, with these, there really aren't any I have found... they are PERFECT for iPods, and honestly, I bought several because I'm afraid I won't be able to find these again and over the years I've tried so many and either returned them or given em away. People who have tried these swear by them... Oh and best of all, they block out noise, they block out the airline sound, they allow you to actually listen to movies on your laptop, the cord is long enough to put a splitter on your laptop and two people watch a movie. We use two of these earbuds with a splitter and have plenty of cord to move around even when we get a "complimentary" upgrade with our frequent flier miles to first class...If you've had the uncomfortable occasion to share a movie with someone with headphones and a short cord, you know how frustrating that can be! So I hope this has been helpful, the sound, that is most important, look at the stats, I'm a media junkie, I have a Apple Macbook Pro, sounds great, I have a Android (Google phone) works great..., I have an iPod, sounds fantastic, and the pc, it sounds great there too.. My absolute favorite is my ipod mini though... that is where I prefer because these are light and the iPod works best with it.

I purchased these earbuds about a week ago. So far they have performed excellently. In my line of work I listen to music for at least 6-7 hours a day. I have been looking for a set out earphones that would block out any outside noise so I could listen to my music without being disturbed. I previously used skullcandy earbuds which worked great but the headphone jack would constantly break and one if not both of the earphones would stop working if I moved the wrong way. One thing I like about these is that the headphone jack has a 90 degree bend in it. This jack doesn't bend and I believe will last longer than the straight jacks. The sound quality is great and it blocks out most outside noise. I was able to vacuum my house and not hear the vacuum cleaner at all. People can talk right in front of you and you can't hear a thing. The only thing I do not like about these earbuds is the wraparound ear pieces. The left earpiece is longer than the right. The left earpiece is supposed to go behind the neck. I'm not a fan of these types but it is a small irritant.

Header: Decent Sound quality, NOT SUITABLE FOR WORKOUT, November 12, 2009
Comment:
I bought these earphones hoping to use them during running workouts. BAD IDEA! I feel like I'm running with a stethoscope. I can hear every little impact - right from my feet hitting the turf to the cord hitting my chest or the back of my head - like I'm in a submarine. From there it gets worse. Once I break a sweat, the perspiration quickly lubricates the earbuds enough to cause them to slip out and its ridiculously annoying. These are terrible for workouts. They have OK sound quality - nothing to rave about. I'd have preferred a less pronounced bass but I can get around that by adjusting the treble output on my iphone. As I was traveling, I couldn't return these within the expiration window so thats adding to my irritation with this product. Edit: These earbuds have started producing a surprisingly good quality of sound after being broken in. I have to grudgingly take back some of my earlier comments. If you manage not to engage in any high impact activity, these are pretty good earbuds for the money. They worked out really great on a recent international flight - these things stay in your ear without causing any discomfort when you roll over on your pillow while asleep. They aren't suited for workouts though.

Sound is better than most stock earbuds, and they are very good at shutting out external noise. Takes a bit of work to get them sized up & fitted correctly, and after that it still takes a while to get used to them. If you get them fitted in your ears just right, they have good frequency range for earbuds, but if you don't, the sound quality seriously suffers. Would have been happy enough with them but after about six months, sound from the left earbud failed. Got them pretty cheap so it's hardly worth it to try to RMA them, even if they are still under warranty. I have the HD580 and HD560 Sennheiser headphones and the sound on those is fantastic and they will last forever. A big reason why I bought these is because I thought I'd get the same sort of quality in these earbuds. It's disappointing to see Sennheiser put their name on an unreliable product.

I'd never used any kind of music player device before I got my new blackberry 8520. However, once I saw that I could play music on internet stations like slacker on it, I decided to get some decent headphones for it to use on my nightly walks. Needlesss to say the blackberry stock ear buds are not so good. Purchased this based on the reviews seen here and on newegg and I'm very pleased with them. Great sound, deep bass, good fit with the medium sized buds (comes with three sizes). Some have complained about the asymmetrical cord, but I love it. You simply put the long cord, which connects to the right ear bud, behind your neck and the cord is out of the way. Normally I'm a sony guy, but for the price it's hard to pass on these. I recommend them.

These earbuds are the best I've ever had. The ones previous usually ended up breaking or losing sound in an ear. I've had these buds for 6 months so far and their great! They fit perfectly in your ear and you can't hear anything on the outside. It's almost scary how good the sound reduction is, I can't hear a thing besides my music. It almost seems kind of dangerous, I think I might end up walking into an oncoming car without hearing it. However, these ear buds are great and I love them.

I got these earbuds around five months ago, they started out perfect for me. I don't know sound very well but they were fine for mp3 on an iPod touch with good bass. The problem with these earbuds is that the right earbud stopped working, it appears the cord connection broke on the inside, since it only works when I bend the cord werid. Overall the sound is decent but the durability is horrible

Header: OK fit and sound ... but two annoying design flaws, October 23, 2009
Comment:
I'm a big fan of Sennheiser headphones. I own two corded sets and two cordless sets of their headphones. This was my first purchase of Sennheiser earbuds. Personally, I find the fit better than my j-buds and comparable to my skull-candy earbuds. The silicone buds are very comfortable -- much more so than the foam rubber buds on some products. The sound quality is comparable to other earbuds in this price range -- decent for popular music, but not of the quality that audiophiles will be looking for. My gripes with the Sennheiser earbuds (and the reason for the three-star review) are as follows: 1) The cords leading to the left and right earbuds are very different lengths -- one is roughly three times the length of the other. Sennheiser says this is so you can wear the earbuds behind your head to reduce cord strain. That's fine, if you like to have your earbud cords running up your neck and into your ears from the back. Personally, I find this inconvenient, since my iPod is usually in my front jacket pocket when walking or my front shirt pocket on airplanes, and the extra 10 inches of cord on the right side is a nuisance. I wish the product description had called out this "feature" explicitly so I could have picked a different model. 2) As another reviewer noted, the packaging is absurd. Normally, I don't get too worked up about clamshell packages -- they're annoying, but taking an extra 30 seconds to cut open the packaging really doesn't bother me too much. This package, however, set a new standard for impenetrability. After working on the package for a couple of minutes with kitchen scissors and a special-purpose clamshell package opener, without success, I finally had to take it down to the workshop and hack away at it with a shop knife. No joke -- you'll need a box cutter and gloves to get this thing open. Bottom line: I still love Sennheiser headphones in general, but there are two good reasons that this particular model is available at a discount. Sennheiser's normally excellent product designers made two bad choices on this model.

I go through earbuds pretty quickly because I run and work out with them so they have a typical life span of no more than a year. That being said although I am not an audiophile I have taken a few diffrent brands and models of earbuds for a test drive. Obviously for below 20.00 I didnt expect a top of the line product but these ear buds look, sound, and feel/fit great. I am very pleased and would highly reccomend these. The only reason they didnt get 5 stars is because I know there are higher quality products out there but below 50.00 these cant be beat. As for the asymmetric cords, I get it, and understand why they are that way, but I am not a fan. Even with the asymmetric cords these earbuds still rock.

These headphones are THEE little guys to get. Sound is very impressive, especially considering the price. After comparing them a few times to the factory iPod headphones, these have much better bass response and overall clarity. The iPod headphones aren't that horrible actually, it's just how they go in your ears that is horrible. These "noise isolating" earbuds are well worth the purchase, simply so they don't fall out of your ears when you turn your head. I'm very impressed with these.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the headphones. The price is excellent, and they are very comfortable in your ears. There are three sets of rubber pads for the earbuds, so you can adjust them for the ideal fit. The cord length for each bud is different, so you wrap the right cord behind your neck. This may sound weird, but it prevents you from having a long cord flap on your chest the whole time. When walking to work, I do notice a slight whistling of the wind across the headphones, but it's not too bad. I also find these headphones to be a bit bass-heavy. It was striking at first, but I'm starting to get used to it. Ideally, I wish they were more balanced, but I can't complain given the price.

Header: Comparison Review Senn CX300 vs Sony Sony MDR-EX71, September 26, 2009
Comment:
I'm a very critical listener. I mostly listen to pretty exotic audiophile headphones. But I really like having low-cost (under $40 -low risk) ear buds. My low-cost ear buds of choice have been the Sony MDR-EX71. I picked up these Sen CX300's to evaluate as a present for a friend. The cost was quite reasonable and worth the few bucks. Noise Blocking and Comfort: Sound blocking is good. the CX300 and the Sony MDR-EX71 are largely the same in terms of the amount of sound blocked. The Sony MDR-EX71 have very soft ear inserts, they are almost silky and very supple. The CX300s are somewhat stiffer, but not in any significant or uncomfortable way. The Fit: Fit is important to insuring sound and I made sure the buds were fully and deeply seated in my ears for best listening. The goal of a noise damping ear buds like these is to cut exterior sound, protect your ears, reduce overall noise, AND allow you to listen well at comfortable and lower volumes. The CX300s are smaller than the Sony MDR-EX71. the fit and comfort is good for someone large or quite small. I'm guessing the CX300s will fit someone who is very petite. For someone larger they will be deeply recessed into the ear, and quite low profile. The Sound: The Senn CX300s don't fare well in a listening comparison. They have a very muddy bass. The mid-range is muffled. The highs are harsh. The sound is boxy and muted. Push the volume up and the CX300s become loud and really harsh - very distorted and compressed sound. The detail of the music is missing and masked in muddiness. They have very poor sound stage. The Sony MDR-EX71, while not an audiophile paradise, are significantly better in terms of sound, response, detail, and imaging. The CX300s are not [...], but for the difference in price, the Sony MDR-EX71 are completely worth the extra $10-15. Conclusion: I'll keep these around for video conferencing, and just to have an extra disposable set of ear buds. At $17 they are just not worth returning. But if you are looking for ear buds that produce really good sound at an affordable price, I would look elsewhere. The Sony 71s much more than double the sound quality for less than double the price. If you want to invest in even better sound consider some of the Shure or Etymotic in-ear-headphones with noise blocking. These can be had in the $50-100 range. If you want a cheaper solution get the Sony MDR-EX71s, they are pretty open, clear, and balanced. Sony MDR-EX71SLA Fontopia Bud-Style Headphones with Case (White)

Comment:
I've had these for a few months now and I go through headphones fairly quickly because I wear them practically all day. I take public transportation to and from work/school and at work I'm allowed to keep headphones on. The sound quality is good IMHO but I'm no audiophile. More important to me was that these fit well and were comfortable, which they are. They don't fall out of my ears easily or anything like that and the rubber that goes in your ear is pretty soft so it doesn't hurt. Like most earbuds these days they come with a couple sizes so you should be able to find one that fits your ears reasonably well. About the only complaint I have with these is that the cord does run a little short. It reaches from my hip pocket to my ears and I'm about 5'10" and it reaches okay enough but most headphones have more wiggle room. Occassionally, when I'm wearing pants with deep pockets, the cord's not long enough and I can force them out of my ear by moving too much or tiliting my head too much. I do tend to move a lot when I'm working and it hasn't become annoying enough to get different headphones or anything so it's mostly a very mild annoyance.

Around two years ago I got this earphones, and I was pretty satisfied with their quality and sound. They became my favorite earphone ever, so much that I recommended to everybody that I knew it was looking for new earphones. Well after some heavy abuse on my side I end up loosing them. So I went I bought the same earphones, at the beginning I was surprise to see their price went down a lot, but after my previous experience I decided to go and buy them. Two day's later I got them on my hand. I didn't like the feeling of the cable and how thin it was the connector, but hey this just seems cosmetic. After using it for few day's I realized they have almost no Bass at all and the quality of sound it extremely inferior. So now I understand why they where so cheap. Save your money and get something with more value.

These probably won't satisfy the audiophile -- their sound is clearly tuned for portable listening -- but they are comfortable, provide pretty good isolation, seem to be well made, and are very efficient. These are perfect, both cost- and performance-wise, for keeping in your laptop bag for travel and casual use.

Comment:
The sound on these ear buds are really nice. Full bass and they fit fairly comfortably in your ear. Problem is the cord. One side is shorter than the other - making it look ridiculous to wear in front of your body. The directions show to wear them behind your body - but running a cord under my armpit to access my mp3 player just didn't work or feel right to me.

Header: Best earbuds for the money, August 27, 2009
Comment:
(VINE VOICE)
Hmmm. Where shall we start. How about with some backstory.... I have really terrible short-term memory due to inattentive ADHD, which causes me to lose things nearly constantly. I always buy three or four copies of everything if I can - keys, sunglasses, so when I can't remember where I put [whatever the item is] I can find something similar and get on with my day. Consequently, I have about six pairs of relatively inexpensive earbuds to go with the three or four IPod Shuffles I own. This way I always have something to listen to. :) I'm comparing the Sennheisers mostly to the $20-range Phillips models - not a terrible option, and widely available in big-box discount stores, which makes them easy to replace. The main difference I've noticed is the fit (Sennheisers are a tad bit better). Anyway, I really think these earbuds are the best for the money. The fit in my own ear canals is so snug that I was able to use them for a goodly portion of five hour airline flight yesterday afternoon without hearing much outside noise at all. I didn't expect much sound quality from such an inexpensive pair of headphones, but they're really pretty good! I think the fidelity is excellent, and these are sturdily made - they're not cheap and seeming as though they'll fall apart quickly. Of course you know from reading other reviews the CX300s also come with other sets of silicon sleeves to fit differently-sized ears. The only reason I'm not giving these five stars is the fact that the cords (!) are a little noisy. If I walk around in these, hiking or whatever, the cords connected to the earbuds move in such a way that it causes kind of a loud squeaking noise. It's hard to explain. If you're going to be doing a bunch of walking using your headphones, I'd suggest the higher-end Apple Computing earbuds - they're well made and with a good range of fidelity but they're also four times as expensive as these, so you'll have to work a little harder to keep up with them. ;) Hope it helps! Happy listening!

Header: Beautiful, Well-Balanced Sound, August 26, 2009
Comment:
I was seeking a earphone that would provide a nice balance between the bass-heavy warmth of the Sony MDR-EX51LP and the detailed brightness of the Creative EP-630. I own both these earphones, and while I found the warmth of the Sonys relaxing, I missed the detail, whereas with the Creatives the bright detailed sound quickly induced listening fatigue. Thankfully, the Sennheiser CX300 earbuds provided me with the exact balance of sound I needed. They possess the rich, warm bass of the Sonys, but add the fine detail of the Creatives. The resulting sound is rich, sweet and delightful. Although the build quality is good, the cord is a little fine, and the unit doesn't appear to be as robust as the other two brands. However, I don't see any obvious problems. The unit feels good, fits well, and performs exactly as I want it to. In fact, it has exceeded my expectations for a unit of this price. Therefore, I am pleased to warmly recommend the Sennheiser CX300 earbuds as an excellent set of budget earphones.

Header: CX300-B Earbuds.... not music to my ears..., August 26, 2009
Comment:
I have an ever growing problem of needing a new pair of headphones every few weeks. So, as usual I turned to Amazon to resolve my issue. I came across the Sennheiser CX300-B's and said to myself "wow, those earbuds look pretty comfortable and are small enough to go un-noticed." Upon receipt and use of the earbuds I was a little disappointed. Let me list my pros and con's to make things a bit easier: PRO's: - Deep bass, and pretty decent sound ( as is usual with all Sennheiser products ). - Under $20. - Sturdy, seem like they are going to last longer than the average pair. CON's: - Cord design is flawed. Routing the cable behind your head is fine, but not when it shortens the length of the cable such that the earbuds ( especially on the short side ) are yanked from your ears with any sudden movement. - The plastic earbud covers do not hold the earphones in your ears very well at all. I know there are different sizes, but they just don't cut it. Overall, I would not personally recommend these earphones to anyone I know. If you want to give them are try for yourself; seeing as they are so cheap, go right ahead... you really can't go wrong for the price. But if you want top quality cheap earphones ( if they do exist ) look elsewhere.

Comment:
The bass definitely has some kick to it. The higher frequency sounds aren't as clear as I would have liked them though. Listening to hip hop on my ipod, I feel that the bass overpowers the song. I'm currently using the bass reducer eq, which definitely helps. The noise reduction that they mention comes from the way the earbuds fits in your ear. The default buds fit perfectly in my ears and blocks out sound pretty well for the price I paid. Goods: Asymmetric cabling Good noise reducing design for price I paid Bad: Higher frequency sounds aren't as clear as I wanted but are tolerable overtime Other notes: My first time with earbuds that have angled jack. Feels like these won't be breaking anytime soon. I've had Skullcandy($50) and ipod earphones break because of their jacks; both jacks were straight. The cable seems a bit thin compared to other earbuds that I have had. Upon further experiementation I found that using the treble booster eq made all my songs sound much better. If you are looking for the best balance between price and quality in this price class, I would recommend this product. Thanks for reading.

I've owned this pair since April 2009. This is my first in-ear sound isolating type of earphones. With that said, my comparison with these CX300's are the $9.99 Philips earphones and the earphones supplied with the Apple iPods. These really do a great job of minimizing ambient noise and greatly improves the clarity of the music. For my ears, it has a flat frequency response and they are true to the sound. When listening to Frank Sinatra songs, I am confident that there is no coloring in his voice. With jazz tracks that I play, you can hear the clarity of the cymbals and the hit of the congas. These come with three sets of removable rubber buds. You have to test all three for the best fit. If the fit is not good, there is no bass and the highs would not be clear. Fortunately, I fit into the middle (default) pair. At first, the J-cord design was weird but I got used to it. I felt that this J design made the CX300's stay in my ear better because my shoulders/neck supports the cord and no hanging cord pulls the buds out from my ears. I tried these on an airplane going to and from Las Vegas and they were very good at lowering the plane's engine noise while I was listening to my tunes. The Sennheiser CX-300 is a great pair below $25 to use for a lot of purposes. Go to the gym, listen in the airplane, use it at the laundromat or the park, you can't go wrong. Try 'em out!

I use there earphones at work every day, and they were worth every penny. Because I am on the computer all day, I am often wearing these buds for several hours straight, and they remain comfortable. The sound quality is very good. I'm not a musician or sound tech, but as a layman, I get good base and crisp sound with no special fiddling required. These are very effective at blocking out background noise. I can still hear my phone ring, and if someone really needs my attention, they can get it, but I can screen out the general office chatter without having to pump the volume to ear damaging levels. Highly recommended.

I needed some small ear phones that sealed in the ear fairly well, but were also small. I wear these inside a motorcycle helmet so they function to cut down wind noise as well as allow me to hear my GPS instructions. Although these do not seal off outside noise as well as proper ear plugs, they do a decent enough job to allow me to hear audio that is run through them. The body of the ear phones is small enough to not cause discomfort by pushing on the helmet liner. Perhaps these are not as good as some of the in-the-ear-canal options out there, but these are also MUCH less expensive.

Comment:
These headphones are OK. They are about the same quality if not a modest upgrade from the stock iPod headphones - they do a little better job of sound isolation and a lot better job with bass. However, they are missing mid and high frequencies. If you've ever tried a really good pair of headphones, you notice a sense of space which I believe is brought in by the mid and high frequencies - you do not get that feeling with these headphones - even on strong vocal music. So... for the money, you're getting what you pay for - I don't regret the purchase... but some day when I'm rolling in it I'll drop $150 for a good set.

These headphones are perfect for taking the train or flying. You get good sound quality and decent sound isolation for the price. They are obviously compact - perfect for the traveler.

Over time I have purchased six pairs of these for my family. They are great headphones once they are broken in. They do not take a lot of abuse, but the sound cannot be beat until you get in the $150 MSRP range. Sound is smooth and a bit bassy (although not booming), but sound is crisp enough and not muddy. These have good clarity and are fairly accurate and uncolored. The sound isolation is great for a passive type earphone, and the sound leak to the outside is as little as possible (other people normally do not know what I am listening to). They stand up well to normal use; I use them for six to ten hours a week at the gym. They do not hold up well to abuse such as repeatedly yanking on the cords when they get caught in something, but they are not so expensive that replacing them every couple of years is out of the question. The rubber type wire is great, but is nearly impossible to repair properly if you're so inclined. Beware of the cable length - the left side is much shorter which is a great design for wearing a player on the left arm, but not as good otherwise. As an alternative the CX400 has similar sound and comes with a short, even length cable and an extension cord.

I have owned these headphones for two years now. I frequently use them at the gym or just for listening to music discretely on my laptop. I've put these headphones through a lot of abuse, including washing and drying them. They still work as well as the day I bought them and the sound is great. It's got decent bass for the size (you can't expect great bass from earbuds, unfortunately, but these do a great job) and the sound is really clear. I also haven't experienced any of the noises other people report from banging the wires or shaking them.

So I have gone through 3 sets thus far. They sound AMAZING! I love them to death but the left ear ALWAYS dies and customer service is INCREDIBLE since they have a 2 year factory warranty. I would suggest them if your ok with sending them in every 3 months but otherwise get some cans cause I have had my DJ cans for 6 years and never failed me.

I've been listening to these earbuds for a few weeks now and I must say that they sound really good. I bought these to replace my old ipod headphones because I wanted something with more bass and a bit more comfortable to wear in my ears. I'm very happy with these so far because they are both very comfortable and sound really great. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the cord. The left ear wire is really short and has tendencies to fall out of my ear which can be annoying a times. Other than that they are great and I really enjoy listening to my music with them. They were a good purchase.

Only one annoyance with these headphones and that is the asymmetrical cord designed to go around the neck, still prefer the "classic" design but these seem to be the trend now with all headphones so I wont discredit the product. The cord itself is slightly shorter then some other headphones but just about perfect for me, with my phone sitting in my pocket there is only a little slack left over when wearing the headphones, with others' there was more slack to get in the way. Sound quality is the expected for the price range and the buds isolate as expected, just don't expect the noise canceling and quality you get with $100+ sets.

I had been using stock iPod Classic earbuds for my iPod Touch. The Touch's earbuds fell apart and the Classic pair was all I had lying around, although their sound quality was so poor I debated not even listening to my iPod Touch at all--I had to listen to everything at a minimum of 85% volume, and even at that level the highs were tinny and the lows were non-existent. I bought these Sennheiser buds looking for much better sound quality and durability; they more than delivered. The Sennheiser buds fit snugly into my ears, as opposed to just resting inside of them as the iPod ones did. The result was that much less ambient noise was audible (they're essentially earplugs that can pipe sound into your ears). Note: I have big ears, but if you don't, the buds come with three sizes of plug adapters--the largest ones come pre-installed. Another result of the snug-fitting buds is that I can listen to everything at around 5% volume, which I know extends my Touch's battery life. In fact, I was able to listen to my iPod while mowing the lawn (power mower) and was able to hear the music decently enough at 50% volume. Also, the sound is very rich: good bass, non-tinny highs. It terms of durability, the Sennheiser had two nice features. First, the headphone jack connector is in a durable plastic L shape. This means I don't put stress on the place where the jack meets the wire when I wrap the headphones around my iPod. Secondly, the left and right earbud wires have different lengths; the intention is that you wear the right earbud with its wire around the back of your neck. This reduces the amount of tug that occurs on your earbuds if you raise your head or if you pull away your iPod too far. I've been more than impressed with the quality of these earbuds. You definitely get your money's worth; I highly recommend them.

First off, the sound is amazing. Lows are deep and highs are crisp. Unfortunately, outside sound from the cord transfers easily, causing interference. I tried listening to a quiet song while walking, and the sound from the cord banging against my chest was like listening to my heart through a stethoscope. I tried listening to a podcast outside on a breezy day, and it sounded like it had been recorded on the top of a mountain! These would be great for sitting at the computer but not for outside activity.

Comment:
Important! - Do not buy these unless buying directly from a reputable reseller (ie Amazon). Apparently there is black market that is selling knock-off versions of these for as low as $1.00! The fake version of these headphones work as simple headphones but they do not compare in quality. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought a pair from the electronic bay. Other manufactures like Sony and Creative (EP-630) sell identical headphones and all have fallen into the same boat. Quick way to know if you received a non-genuine version: - Packaging: headphones comes in a simple chrome plastic bag - Plastic near 3.5mm headphone jack is hard instead of rubbery and flexible - Microphonics is a serious issue - Popping or serious crackling sound when you slip the headphones on For my immature ears they have sound quality. There is good balance of bass and treble. They also isolate sound well and therefore you don't have to turn the volume up too high (so you don't have to be that annoying guy on the metro who blares his music so everyone can hear). I bought these on sale (~$20) about a year ago and I've fallen in love with them. I'm getting ready to buy an extra pair for the office. So please throw away the earbuds that came with your iPod/iPhone and invest in a pair of these.

Header: great but not amazing -- get some cx400s instead!, May 13, 2009
Comment:
I would not go so far as to call myself an audiophile -- the most expensive pair of headphones I have ever owned are a pair of second-hand Sennheiser HD595's, which are my mainstay reference pair for just about everything. They were properly broken in with 1000+ hours when I bought them for about $70 -- my friend had gotten a pair of studio AKGs (which sound absolutely amazing). But for commuting to school and walking around in public, they're just too damn big. I needed a pair of IEMs for mobile, everyday usage. So I got some Senn CX300s. I wanted to get the CX400s, but at the time it was not on sale like it is now. The CX300s sound pretty damn good. Extremely unbalanced -- that is to say, the lows (bass) and highs (treble) dominate them. When you first get them, mids are more or less non-existent. So expect the center frequencies to sound very metallic, the bass to be punchy and booming, and the highs to be very harsh and bright. The CX400s are the CX300s with a symmetric cable, an extension cable, and better balanced mids and highs. For $5, it's well worth the upgrade. Especially now so on sale for just shy of $30 (!!). When I bought my CX300s, they were $30 and the CX400s were $50. But if you can't get some CX400s, the CX300s aren't too terribly bad either. The issues with the microphonics are completely overdramaticized -- it's not an issue at all if you keep the cable pinned to your coat or under your shirt or just turn your music up a little. I don't notice them at all.

When I first tried them, I couldn't put them down. However, over a few weeks I noticed a deterioration in the sound quality. I was using them on a daily basis with my iPod touch first Generation when all of a sudden when I turned the jack, the vocals of the song I listened to disappeared, and stereo became mono. I was pretty upset as you can imagine, and now when I use them I always have to tweak it here and there to get the right "setting" where it works. Another point to note is that these are horrible for jogging/walking. The sound pulsates to your pace, so it really does take away from the music. Bottom line, these are okay for their price, but I would save up and buy a good pair.

Header: Good sound but not for sensitive ear canals, May 3, 2009
Comment:
This was my first experience with ear canal phones. I read most of the reviews here and elsewhere and had the impression that these earphones would have about the comfort level of standard ear plugs. Well, when I got them I tried them with the medium and small fittings and decided that the small size fit me better. However, the small fittings are little smaller in diameter than the earphone base. Also, all the fittings have a slight seam about half way down the diaphragm. Since my ears aren't used to having anything in them (the default iPod style ear phones hurt my ear lobes after a less than an hour) I believe it's this seam that causes my ear canal to burn when I insert the earphones. I've used them 5 times since I got them and I am impressed with the sound (once the phones are snug so the fitting's diaphragm has solid contact with the ear canal). I'm hoping that over time my ears will toughen enough for these phones to not hurt when I use them. Other Considerations: Because these are ear canal earphones, when they're inserted correctly they reduce outside noise quite well; think earplugs. However, since they do function like ear plugs they have everything that comes with that including the 'loud cord' sending cord vibrations to your ear and causing high sensitivity to internal noise (eating with these inserted isn't pleasant) I did find that I like the J cord because you don't have the cord hanging in front of you and getting in the way.

I have been through many headphones. Mostly on the low to mid level end ($15 - $65). I have tried Skullcandy ($15crap sound IMO), Sony ($65 Broke in a month w/ so so sound), Philips ($40 w/ good sound but had to use extension cable) and now these. I can easily say these are the best sounding out of all of them. They don't have the issue of some earbuds where they have to be perfectly centered to make clear sound. Anyhow at the price I paid(~$35 shipped) these easily sound the best. The newer version may sound a bit better (I honestly don't know) but it had an extension cable that I am not too fond of. So these fit the bill for me. I use them to help me fall asleep and are super comfortable even when I sleep sideways with my ear to the pillow. I also use them for the gym with my Zune 16gb and they do great their to. Best headphones for the price easily!

The sound quality is pretty good, but nothing incredible. Definitely not "audio engineering excellence", that's for sure. Good for podcasts and some light music listening. They would be a 4/5 stars, but I've found them to be pretty fragile. After heavy use for 4-5 months, one of the channels cut out - luckily, there's a warranty that lasts longer than that, so make sure to hang on to what you need to take advantage of it.

Header: If you really like music, get these to ENHANCE YOUR JOY, April 11, 2009
Comment:
If you enjoy listening to music a LOT, want to enhance your JOY in listening to music, and want the convenience of earbuds (instead of wearing the larger headsets), the Sennheiser CX300 earbuds will make your ears want to dance!!! MUCH BETTER THAN STANDARD EARBUDS. Before I got these, I wondered whether there would be a noticeable difference between Apple's standard iPod earbuds (which I think work pretty well) and "better" earbuds. Well, these Sennheiser CX-300 earbuds are far superior. With these, you will enjoy listening to your iPods/MP3 players a lot more, because the sound quality is so good. Also, they come with 3 sizes of earbud covers (small, medium, large). Try out the various sizes until you find the ones that fit best in your ears. SOUND QUALITY. The sound quality is supremely superior to the standard earbuds that come with iPods. These earbuds provide the full hearing range for most people -- from the lowest bass (down to 18 Hz) and up to the highest treble (up to 21 KHz). The bass is very good (though headsets are better),the clarity of the higher-pitched range is very clear, and the midrange sound is very smooth and clear, too. NOISE REDUCTION. With the standard Apple earbuds, in noisy areas and outdoors, I had to turn the volume up much higher than normal to try to listen to my iPod, since the external noise overpowered the sound coming from the iPod. Because these Sennheiser earbuds fit in the ear much better and seal out much more of the external noise, it is possible to listen to iPods/MP3 players at a normal or even softer volume. In a room with a TV turned on at a normal sound level, it is possible to listen to an iPod with these earbuds and either not hear the TV at all or very minimally in the background. NOISE CANCELLATION. These are NOT noise-cancellation headsets. If you really need active noise-cancellation headsets, you shouldn't get these earbuds. However, if you would be happy to have substantially less external noise when listening to your music, these earbuds work great! EXCELLENT VALUE. The price is incredibly low for the quality of these earbuds. Two other things that could make a difference to some people: 1. The earbuds wires are asymmetrical. The longer one is intended to wrap around the back of your neck, which works out very well. If you like to have the wiring in front of you, it works fine but doesn't look symmetrical. 2. When the sound volume is very low, I can hear the sound of the movement of the wires, which could be annoying to some people. When the music is playing at a normal sound volume, I don't hear any noise from the movement of the wires. Ideally, I'd like Sennheiser to make their future earbuds so that no noise is heard when the wires are moved. Would have given these earbuds 5 stars if it didn't make noises when the wires move. OVERALL, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

The sound quality is very good. Shure IEMs aren't really any better. Comfortable earpiece, soft cones feel fine to listen to for hours. The earbuds don't stick out of your ears far. This makes them less likely to fall out and makes them comfortable to wear under a helmet with earpads. The wire is too short, plugging it into a desktop computer barely works. This also means its a perfect fit to go to an ipod in your pocket. The wire is thin, but I've had them for 6 months, use them all the time, and they haven't broke. Noise from the wire is noticeable when heavily vibrated ie skiing. You can find them for under $20. It's a steal.

I accidentally left the mp3 player and the headphones in my shorts and put it in the laundry basket. The headphones made it without a scratch but the mp3 player was a goner. Can't make a better argument in favor of the build quality. The cord noise is not any worse than other headphones. It is certainly elevated if you wear your mp3 player such that the cord hits your hand a lot. I fix the mp3 player on my hip belt or my short and the wire is just dangling in front of my body. The cord noise is hardly noticeable.

Header: Great headphones - but beware of short cord, April 7, 2009
Comment:
These headphones sound great and come with 3 sizes of rubber inserts to adapt to your ear size. I had been using various stock earbuds from MP3 players (Zune standard, Zune premium headphones, and Sansa Fuze) and these sound noticeably better than any of those. Crisp highs and deep bass (if you have them inserted firmly into the ear canal). The Zune Premium headphones sound almost as good as these but they had one big problem that always bothered me - the cord style is such that whenever you rub against it they make a loud noise in the earbud. So if you're listening to music and move in a way that something rubs against the cord it really disrupts the sound. The CX300's don't have this problem. The one drawback to the CX300's is the cord length. I think it is too short and it is also awkward in that one side is longer than the other. The cord is so short that it barely reaches the pocket on the back of my cycling jerseys - I have to run the cord just right to make it work. It's too short to reach a pants pocket. I'm 5'8" and so my torso isn't long. The cord length is more suited for use with a device either on an armband or a front vest pocket.

Header: Best in-ear headphones for a budding audiophile (no pun intended), April 4, 2009
Comment:
I've owned numerous pairs of in-ear headphones from Creative and Apple, and they always fell short in one of two ways: a lack of powerful bass, and comfort. These headphones are a good compromise between the two. Notice that I said compromise. They aren't perfect. However, the symmetrically designed ear cushions are the best I've seen, creating a good seal and likely to conform to almost any ear canal. The seal is important for both comfort and really connecting on the bass. And do they ever. I was blown away by the strength of the bass on first listening, as it's a marked improvement over any other set of in-ear phones I've owned before. In the intervening month, I've become adjusted to them, but the natural frequency balance is still outstanding. Two caveats for potential buyers: these are still value headphones; they're cheaper than higher-end Sennheiser models, and obviously they aren't designed for genuine audiophiles. Having said that, they're more than adequate for extensive casual listening. Secondly, the asymmetrical cable (the wire to the left earbud is much shorter than that to the right) is bound to throw some people off. I got used to it after several days of use, and now appreciate the convenience of never accidentally tugging them out of my ears.

Comment:
I bought these to replace my failing Apple earbuds, and they did a great job replacing them. Unlike typical "professional" quality earphones, they don't have that shockingly short cable with the disgustingly long extension cable. These are the right length to go from my ears into my pockets (though deeper pockets sometimes represent a potential problem). The other problem is that the cabling is so thin that it makes a whistling in the wind, and I don't just mean strong winds, but I mean just by walking. In a strong wind, I found the rest of the cable caught the wind and went everywhere inconvenient, so I can't move my left arm without pulling the earbuds out of my ears. If I walk around with just one earpiece in, the damn things won't stay put. Either the other earbud is being pulled one way (putting too much stress on the earpiece and your neck), or the other way (making the cable tighten up against the player). The sound quality is pretty good, though. Good base response, does a decent job of blocking out sound, and the different sized cuffs make fitting it rather easy. However, if you walk around with just one earbud in, you're not going to get the full experience (probably has some kind of psychoacoustics going on). In all, not a bad pair of headphones for the money, they just require some management.

Yes, when you move the wire around it makes a noise in your headphones, however, the only time you hear the wire is if there is no music playing.. LOL. As long as your have music playing, there is no problem whatsoever. Earbuds fit very very comfortable (I used the largest ones). I listen to hip hop when I am lifting weights and techno when I am doing cardio. WOW, the music sounds so amazing. Great bass and the vocals are wonderful.

I never really understood why manufacturers did this. Anyway, I am not on the hunt for a different pair. I wish I could look past it, but I cant. If that doesnt bother you, then go for it.

In the noise blocking aspect of these headphones I'm very pleased, the street I bike on is very noisy, but I hardly hear it at all anymore! In terms of sound quality these headphones aren't all that bad. When I first listened to them to judge the sound quality they sounded very tinny, but I decided to listen to them anyway and it seems you have to break them in a little because they sound just fine now! Highly recommended, well worth the $30 price of admission.

I had a pair of Sennheiser behind the head sport headphones which had very good sound and thought that these would be comparable. Unfortunately I was surprised to find out that this was not the case. These earbuds are all treble with almost no discernible bass. The highs themselves are pretty good and the sound is clear, but it's totally thin and harsh with no bottom to it. I can't believe I am reading people say how they like the bass. What bass? There are some reviewers here however who had the same reaction I did. I would take the stock iPod ear buds over these. That's how bad they are. I know Sennheiser has such a good reputation, but this is not the first time I find them to have too much treble. I also have a pair of HD 280 pro headphones, and while they are much better than these I never liked them too much, because I find them a bit too harsh and bright. The Sennheiser sport headphones however were surprisingly good so I'm 1 for 3 with Sennheiser. I know a lot of people dislike Bose, but if you want good bass get the Bose in ear headphones which I found to have a very rich and satisfying sound, although they have almost no sound isolation. They are way better than the CX300's.

I have used these every day for the last six months and am extremely satisfied. They are low profile and do a pretty good job isolating noise. On a crowded bus you can turn on music and not really hear anyone or anything around you. The left headphone cord is longer so that you can put the cord behind your neck, or in your shirt. They are very comfortable in my ears. Also they are very durable, I haven't been that careful with them, jerk them around and accidentally blare music through them and they are still just like new (although it's only been 6 months). They are advertised for their bass, but the bass isn't really that extraordinary, which is fine for me, I mean, they have plenty of bass, and they sound amazing, but it's not overpowering. $22 on amazon is a steal. I would pay as much as $50. UPDATE: these headphones developed a short after about 15 months. But that's pretty good for $25 headphones that were heavily used.

I bought these and the other $20 Jbuds on this site. I tend to like Sennheisers more. The senn's bass sounds more rich, and the sound seems a little more clear. They fit pretty tight in the ear, which I like. It feels like the sound is better when there is no room for air to escape. It seems like the senn's are more audible than the jbuds from outside the ear. So I use my jbuds at work so I don't bother anyone, and my senn's outside of work.

I bought these for my 13 year old sister to replace her cheap earbuds. She likes the headphones and claims the sound quality is good and that they block out outside noises, to boot. The only thing that was confusing initially is that cable to one of the ears is much longer than the other so that the headphones seem lopsided. Apparently this is because you're supposed to wrap that earpiece around the back of your head so it doesn't get in the way as much. Overall, my teenage sister loves these headphones.

Best pair of ear buds at this price range I ever bought. Great sound quality and isolation. I had the Sony MDR-EX81LP Bud-Style Stereo Earphones (White) and the CX 300 gave same or better quality sound, fits better with better isolation. The silicone rubber stays on well. Sony had slightly more bass but I kept losing the damn silicone, and the pair broke after 3 months ( my guess is the wire broke inside). I hope the CX300 last longer.

Header: Great value... if you don't mind muddy bass, February 4, 2009
Comment:
If you absolutely can't bear to shell out the money for good earphones, these are for you. After a 30 hour burn-in the mids and highs on these were quite passable. A little bit flat and in your face, but good sharpness for a cheap set. The bass is overemphasized, muddy, and prone to distortion. Four stars because they're still better than other phones in the price range. People upgrading from crappy sansa/ipod/etc earphones will be so happy to hear something close to what their music actually sounds like that they may not even notice how bad the bass is.

This item is absolutely great. I got them at a cheap price way below retail here on amazon. They are well worth your money and they sound great! I have used them on the bus and at other noisy places and they are great in blocking sound. Of course you won't get a complete seal, but it does block out most of it and it gives me a rich pumping bass sound! I strongly urge you to buy this product.

Header: Bad Design for Working Out, January 24, 2009
Comment:
These headphones are impossible for me to wear while working out. They fall out of my ears constantly and the two different cord lengths for the ear buds are annoying. One ear bud basically supports all the weight of the cord from your one ear, causing it to easily fall out. You can also hear the motion of the cord if it brushes against your clothing. The sound quality isn't too bad, but I hate the design.

I was oriented on the JBUDS but a revew quote that they have no good treble response. So I choose the CX300-B. And I'm very happy.bass are smooth and deep treble natural and cristal. I use them most in gymn with a Shuffle ipod. The ipod's original are maybe a little louder but they are difficult to wear for long time. They have hard rims,and let pass a lot of noise from the ambient. The CX almost floats in you ears!They also isolate well in airplane and you can rest the head over ears with no problem. The only warning is that I suffer a pain at the the right ear during the landing phase. Maybe, since the silicon cap (all brands not only for the CX300!!)isolates the outer part of the ear, and pressurizing the airplane can hurt. Better remove often to compensate the pressure. definitely a good purchase, specially at this price.

Comment:
After my cat chewed through the wires on my favorite pair of headphones, I came to amazon looking for either a kitty coffin or a new pair of headphones. I had heard good things about Sennheiser in the past, and the other reviews seemed favorable. -The good- I enjoy these headphones because they have very good sound quality. It's a very balanced sound. Many headphones I have tried are too heavy on the bass or treble, these are just right. Additionally, the price is very reasonable for what you get. There's little need to spend $100+ on in-ear headphones, audiophiles are crazy. -The bad- The only complaint I have about these are physical. The cord for the right ear is significantly longer (6+ inches) than the left. I understand why they are made like this, but I'd really just prefer them to be equal length. It's a minor annoyance, but it was big enough for me to only give them 4 stars. All in all, you can't go wrong with Sennheiser.

For the price of these earbuds, you cannot go wrong if you are even considering them. You might be a bit happier with a higher-end set of earbuds, but you will definitely have to spend more money. The Sennheiser CX300-B earbuds fit my ears perfectly right out of the box and there is certainly more base response then my girlfriends set of Etymotic E6i and were more comfortable. The CX300-B's don't block out as much extraneous noise or have quite the same sound reproduction capability, but you will be pleased with their overall sound. If you decide you really need high performance earbuds or bragging rights for the most expensive ones in your gang...you'll always be able to use these at the gym or when you don't want to risk damaging or losing your more expensive earbuds. I would have given them 5 stars, but at this price I believe 4 stars is very fair.

I bought these for my wife to go with the Ipod I got her for Christmas. She loved them, I was not surprised as I have used Sennheiser headphones for years. She really liked the sound and with the three ear piece sizes she doesn't have to worry about them falling out. In fact she shoveled the driveway when it snowed, and I was at work, with them in and they never came out. You can spend more but i doubt your will get better without spending A LOT more.

When I read the product information on these earbuds I wanted to believe that they were very bass oriented. In reality they were dissapointing in that there is no bass to speak of.

I would not recommend these for purchase if you are looking for very base booming sound.

Comment:
When I first got an MP3 player and listened to the sound, I was thunderstruck. After years of declining hearing to the point of no longer caring about listening to my home sound system, I was hearing my music clearly! This experience was soon heightened by exchanging the original on-the-ear pads for inexpensive in-th-ear buds. Now I have to report at least as great an improvement by exchanging the buds for the Sennheiser model. These ear buds have a much improved frequency range and response and allow me to listen to my MP3 player at lower volume levels while still providing a very enjoyable listening experience. These ear buds have changed my music world almost as much as the original purchase of an MP3 player.

Comment:
It took me a few tries to figure how to properly use these 'phones (You have to seal them deep in your ear, not just place them in there like the old iPod ones I was used to). But since I was able to figure them out, I have not been able to force myself to use those old iPod earphones - the sound quality is that much better. The attenuation of nearby noises is great. I can't hear a thing, even on a relatively low volume setting. The wire is different as it wraps around your neck but that just takes some adjusting and is not a big deal. I love Sennheiser products and have stuck to them when it comes to buying new headphones (I currently own three different pairs). These CX300-B are great value for the money ($20) and you will not be disappointed.

I didn't like the asymmetrical cord so I went and bought the Sony mdr-ex75 for my sansa view. I bought the Lenntek Sonix at costco because I need a second one but returned within the same day. I was about to get the second Sony earbuds but the price and glowing reviews made me go for the Cx-300 and it turned out to be the best out of 3. The Lenntek has so much bass and no midrange and high freq. The Sony has good midrange and clarity but no bass at all. The Cx-300 has decent bass and good midrange and high freq and it made me realized the sony doesn't have bass. It's very small and fits wells in my ears. I don't like the asymmetrical cord but I can trade for the sound quality. To those who have problem with the noise with the in ears buds when jogging, use a small piece of masking tape to fix the cord to your shirt. I usually tape it right at the collar and the length from there to your ears should be not to tight so you can turn your head and not too loose.

This is the best earbuds I've ever had. The sound was crisp and clear. I could hear things that weren't audible on my MDR51s. The bass was very good and it definitely kept outside noise to tolerable levels. I had to replace the original earpiece with a more rigid one (from my MDR51) as the one that came with the buds were too soft. When I did that, the sound got even better with much less outside noise. If you want great sound at a very reasonable cost, this is for you.

Everybody disses the stock earphones that come with your MP3 player. But those that came with my Creative Zen had excellent sound. But they have two other problems: (1) the are external buds which are not as comfortable as in-ear phones, and (2) the little foam-like covers they come with slip off all the time. So I went with Sennheiser because of previous experience. They are comfortable and adequate but leave a lot to be desired audially. But then they are so cheap, what do you expect? If you are on a tight budget and not too fussy about sound, Go for them!

For the price they are being sold. DAMNNNNNNNNN I will get another pair just to have them in case something happens to these ones I currently have. Great bass, great fit, I used mid and large buds for determination of which ones fit best. Large ones can be used if you want a snuger fit, but the mid size is just as good. I've been reading reviews of other earbud phones and these ones beat the price and sound. There are other ones much much better than these out on the market, but they are either expensive and delicate (you have this weird feeling that you need to treat them like holding eggs so that they won't brake, for the money you gave for them). But these Sennheiser earbuds are I'll say again great and for the price that Amazon.com has on them, certainly beats Sony, Koss or any other brand name. Bass is great, sound so crispy so I do not need to keep my Zen up at the high level to hear everything.

I bought a pair of the Sennheiser CX-300W earbuds a little over six months ago and I love them. They are very comfortable, and fit well. They are also great quality and seem very sturdy; I have yet to have any issues with them. When I first got them, I was a little disappointed with the sound because it was different from my previous earbuds, but I have grown to love it. It's very crisp and clear. I had previously owned a pair of "canal" earbuds and loved the fit, but they had a design flaw and developed a short after about a month. Then I found this pair and got the what I had wanted in my previous pair: comfort and quality. To sum it all up in one sentence, I am convinced that the Sennheiser CX-300 series earbuds are excellent (and certainly the most comfortable) earbuds available and I highly recommend them.

Comment:
I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago. I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality. I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out. I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in. Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running. This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard. I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear. I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long. I have switched to a pair of Ultimate Ears and the quality is even better, hopefully these will last longer.

The mids and highs are not quite as defined, but if you're like me, I love bass in all types of music and mids and highs aren't as important. By the way, the ones I just got from amazon are the real deal. I'm sure going to enjoy going deaf.

So I ordered new ones, and only 6 months later the same thing happened. If they didn't break (twice) they would be 5 stars. I only recommend this product if you listen quietly.

The bass in these headphones are not very overpowering and meld well with the mids and highs. It comes with 3 fitment plugs so a perfect fit is almost guaranteed. Since it is an in-ear type, it does provide some noise isolation, so it's good to use on the plane with your ipod or other music device. I use mine at work every day and am quite pleased with this purchase.

Header: Great Headphones, October 9, 2008
Comment:
I've had these headphones for about 10 months now and they're just starting to break on me. They're the best headphones I've ever bought, and definitely the longest lasting. I used to buy horrible $5.00 headphones from Target that would last me about two weeks. The Sennheiser earbuds really showed me that headphones should be an investment in themselves. $5.00 every two weeks adds up to about $120 a year. These were about $40 and lasted me 10 months. Sure, the right side of the headphones don't work anymore, but I'm very rough with my headphones. The durability of these things is amazing. I've stuck them in my pocket, forced them apart when tangled and thrown them around and the quality of the sound and fit didn't even change. The headphones have a nice fit, as well. I have a bigger ear hole in my left than my right, so the interchangeable covers was a huge help. Bass response is amazing, even though they're not open-air headphones. I have a pair of Grado SR60's and the bass is comparable (which is saying a lot when talking about earbuds). The overall sound quality is good, as well. There's no detectable distortion in the mids - but the very high sounds - like excessive cymbal crashes and loud snares, will make poppy distortions. The first complaint I had about these was that the wire was loud. Meaning, if you have the earbuds in and something touches the wire, you can hear a bouncing sound like steel cables on a suspension bridge. It's not a problem if the music's playing, but it's annoying in between songs. You get used to it after a while, though, and now I don't even notice it. These are, again, the best headphones I've used. I'm thinking about buying another pair, but I'm not sure if I should limit myself to one pair of headphones. But, if you've never bought decent headphones before, you won't be disappointed.

If you have never used asymetrical cords before these will be a problem. In spite of liking the price and thinking they sounded good once I managed to get them sufficiently wedged into my ears, I looked like a fool at the gym trying to keep the long cord from snagging and the cord around the back of my neck was annoying. There are better models to get for the gym but it seemed dumb to get two pairs for specific uses when they are making better, cheaper ones every day. Basically, the asymetrical cords was something I had not really noticed until they arrived and I wish I had known.

Comment:
New Buyer Beware! I purchased the CX-300 B back in August 2007, and was absolutely thrilled with the performance. The right earpiece stopped working properly almost exactly 1 year later. The price on these was just right, so I bought a new set. What a disappointment. In A-B comparison, my left ear only model produced much better bass, and much more natural mid-range. The new model is overly bright in the mid-range, and the bass has virtually disappeared. Looking at the earbuds, the new model is a matte black, and the screen protecting the driver is a much larger "grid pattern". The old model has a glossy finish, a finer grid pattern, and inserts more fully in the ear. Now I need to try and find a place to repair my old ones. The new CX-300 is an extreme disappointment.

Header: Best quality earbuds for the price, July 18, 2008
Comment:
I've had these earbuds for over a year and they have held up great. The sound quality is very good. Clear, strong base and excellent treble. I don't mind the "Behind the neck" style cord that others have complained about. I don't use them to run or workout. I find that most in-ear buds are not good for active sports. I would recommend a different specialized headphone for working out with. The Sony earbuds have a faulty cord made out of some very delicate soft rubbber. The cord on these are very durable and after a year look just like thaey did when I bought them. In my opinion they are the best earbuds under $50.

Header: Great comfortable high quality headphones, June 26, 2008
Comment:
The first thing I noticed about these headphones was how comfortable they were in my ear. I own other in-ear phones that are not as nice as these. The sound quality is fantastic, which is expected of Sennheiser. They also do a really good job of blocking out external noise. However, don't confuse that with noise-canceling headphones. There's a big difference!! The only issue I have with the headphones is the short/long wire setup. This forces one to put your portable media device on the left side of your body. For some reason, I've gotten used to the right side, so this took some getting used to. Other then that, they are great and I would highly recommend. The only other comment that I have is about the in-ear design. The only time I don't like wearing these is when I'm already in a quiet room. I can hear myself breath through the headphones, which is kind of strange. I wonder if others have the same experience. I much rather use over the ear headphones in those situations. These headphones are great when used in noisy situations, like on a bus/train, or cutting the lawn. Another alternative is to use the noise-canceling headphones.

These headphones Rock! Very comfortable and have good soundstage. The bass response is quite surprising and not overloaded. The highs are crisp and sound balanced while the mid-range is very clean. I am not an audiophile but for the price of these earbuds you dont need to be to appreciate them.

Header: Great sound but very annoying wires and lots of wooshing, April 24, 2008
Comment:
The sound of these is as good as the Sony MDR-71 BUT: - the wires are stiff and annoying - they get in your face. the Sony wires are more convenient. - When you do any activity or when you move in any way, you get a lot of swooshing noise. jogging is a real uncomfortable task with these. Trust me on that. - The wires keep getting caught in your cloths (the wires are "sticky" for durability but the result is that the buds get yanked out of your ear) - One bud doesn't fit well and seems less sealed then the other ear. so I'm going back to Sony MDR 71. It's worth it even if the wires degrade a little faster: I'll just buy a new pair every couple of months.

Header: Pay Attention to the 1 Star Sound Reviews, April 14, 2008
Comment:
The August 2007 issue of MONEY Magazine included these in a review of 6 noise cancelling in-ear-headphones. They listed them at $90 with "only moderate sound quality; not a good choice for the price", and described them as "the bass is not clear and the treble sounds too bright". I tried them for about half the the MONEY Mag price. It's a toss up as to whether they are worthwhile at that price. If you are at all picky, or listen to clasical music much, you should visit the 1 and 2 star reviews that comment on the sound quality.

Comment:
It has been over two months ever since I bought these earbuds and they're definately the best pair I've owned. I was also considering a Shure e2C but chose the Sennheiser for the price. Since my purchase, I had the chance to give the Shure e2C earbuds a try as well when my roommate got a pair. The Sennheisers are as good as the Shure earbuds if not better. I was glad I got these after I tried Shure because these Sennheisers have a better fit in my ear as well becuase of their smaller size. I also wear these to the gym. They've never got loose or dropped even when I run for half an hour straight on the treadmill. Although it is not really the fault of the earbuds, you're going to have to do a little bit of tweaking with the plug if you're an iPod touch or iPhone owner like me. I cut away the plastic coating on the plug by a quarter of an inch. It fits in perfectly once you do that. Otherwise it is the best earbuds you can get for less than $100.

Header: What's with the one-cord-shorter-than-the-other?, April 9, 2008
Comment:
I bought these to replace the buds that came with my iPod. They are a marked improvement in both comfort and sound. Now I can hear the entire range of music, from clear bass tones up through the trebles. Best of all, I don't find myself constantly adjusting the volume up or down depending on ambient noise. I use these mostly on the subway. With the stock iPod headphones, I would often end up turning the things up so high (without realizing it) that my ears would hurt by the time I got off the train. Not so anymore. I can hear better without putting these up LOUD. These are also quite comfortable, because they fit snugly with soft padding. The only downside to these is that the cord to the left ear is much shorter than the one to the right, so that the "split" hangs right off the left side of my chin, with a bunch of cord hanging off to the right. That feels a little weird, and I'm sure it looks really stupid as well. If I were a bit more insecure, that would really bother me. As it is, it's a minor annoyance.

I don't know how no one wrote about this yet, maybe it's a new feature, but the pair of CX300-B I picked up in London had an "iPhone compatible" sticker on them, and they are indeed a perfect fit for the iPhone. They sound incredible. Amazon should check if the product is now iPhone compatible in the USA as well. Highly recommended, especially at this price range.

I get an excellent sound experience at low volume settings and I find that I can count on little distraction from outside noises. That would not be so good while driving a car but if you are just riding in one or on an airplane - priceless. And it comes in such a small little piece of equipment and at a price that I feel is pretty low for what you get - I bought my first Sennheiser headphones in the early 70's because they were rated highly in a consumer magazine - these are too! Sennheiser continues to do their homework - I have enjoyed both purchases.

I found the sound to be tinny and thin, not nearly as rich as the stock buds that came with my Sandisk m240 MP3 player. I really expected better from Sennheiser. I dont consider the quality of the sound or the construction to be above the average. And certainly not what I expected from dedicated sound drivers, even on the lower end ear-canal buds.

Header: Good, quality sound, weird chord., February 8, 2008
Comment:
overall, the sound is good compared to other earphones. of course, it is not as good as the sound from regular headphones, but it is as close as it gets. On some songs, the bass can seem to be overly amplified, so if you are not into rap/hip-hop, that could get a little annoying. The bad: the chord is not Y shaped, but instead more of a u shape. I made a Y shape out of mine with some tape. The picture of the item is thus deceiving, because it does not show the shape of the chord. P.S Creative makes the exact same headphones (it seems to have bought the patent from this company)I compared my Sennheisers with my brother's Creatives- exactly the same except for the logo.

These earbuds sound great. They are definitely bass heavy, which I actually like. They do a great job of keeping out noise in the environment since they seal in your ear canal. Not good for jogging, but that's not surprising. Also, you will hear every little noise that the rubberized cords make, but that's not surprising either. Great for trips on the airplane. Wish they had a straight jack instead of the L-shaped jack, but that's purely cosmetic. Great sound quality for a reasonable price.

I just picked these up to replace my stock iPod headphones and I am very impressed so far. The sound quality is fantastic, provided the earbuds are properly inserted into the ear canal. Comfort and fit are also miles above the iPod phones. Those who complain about the cord must not be using it correctly, as I have used these at the gym since I received them, and have had no problems with snagged cords or earbuds coming out with sweating. Pick these up and you will be very pleased.

Not quite the same sound as my Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones but for earbuds I am in shock and awe. I'm a little worried about the thin wires, but all earbuds have thin wires. I get the same level in of sound at half the volume on my SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black) than with the factory buds, and that results in quite an extension in battery life. Quite good at keeping out background noise, great freq response, considering that they are ear buds.

I have purchased multiple types of earbud headphones before, and none were quite worth the money that these are. They are the only earbuds that will stay in my ears when running and when compared to Apple's version, it's a matter of night and day. The sound quality is amazing, and they are also surprisingly durable. I'd recommend them to anyone use to Apple's stock version.

Header: Almost great in-ear headphones, October 25, 2007
Comment:
I bought these to add to my collection of headphones. I own the Creative EP-630's, which are similar to these and sound fantastic, but have a symmetrical cord and straight plug, both of which I don't really like. I figured these would sound similar if not better and also have the asymmetrical cord and 90 degree plug which I prefer. They do sound sound somewhat similar to the Creatives--they have punchy deep bass and clear sound, but the frequency balance is quite a bit different. The Sennheisers have more prominent highs than the Creatives, and while this makes them initially sound exciting, I find that I get tired of listening to them sooner than I do the EP-630's. Don't get me wrong--I do like the sound of these, but I like the Creatives just a bit better. I do, however, like the cord on the CX-300s better.

I've used Eshure in-ear or Aiwa ear buds for my last two personal music players. While I loved the Eshures, the darn cords kept shorting out after a year (which, considering the price, is somewhat disconcerting). So I decided to take the plunge reviewing various new ear phones at Amazon that were comparable in quality but much cheaper. We all know reviews are subjective but all the reviews concerning this product seemed to suggest these were the ear buds I was looking for. I was not disappointed. While the cord is a bit shorter than what I'm used to, I just run it under my jacket our outer garment. But the sound is the thing. I've had these headphones for 4 days so far and I'm blown away! I had to adjust my EQ settings (adjusted them to Jazz; the bass in Rock or Disco was fantastic but a bit too much for me) and if these are Sennheiser's low priced ear buds, all I can say is "WOW!" Now, the true test will be how long they last...

I read multiple reviews on this product before diving into the web to find a good price. Received them quickly (bought 2 sets). Did an ear by ear comparison with the Sony's (same style). Two MP3 players with the same song at the same time. Sennheiser in one ear, Sony in the other. I thought the Sony's were pretty good compared to others. Sennheiser CX300 blows the Sony's out of the water. Can't believe how much better they are. Bang for the buck, these are a great find!

I have owned tons and tons of earphones over the years. Each one never really lasted me and didnt give me that sound quality i get from my headphones. I finally found a pair of earbuds that I can say are at par or better than my headphones, I own a pair of Sennheiser px-100's and also a pair of skullcandy skullcrushers. These earbuds are extremly comfortable. They offer premium sound quality which includes the passive noise cancellation. I use them on the subway and bus and get really good isolation. Since their passive noise cancellation theres no nead for batteries. Come with 3 different size earbud covers. Only to main drawbacks: you do have to play with earbuds in your ear canal with the positioning to get that perfect noise cancellation and bass, but you do get used to it after a while and becomes easier as time goes on. Also I do wish they came with a nice case for the price. Other than that their a great product and Sennheiser makes great earbuds and headphones.

Comment:
To date I have purchased 4 sets of these over the past 3 years and nothing else has ever come close to the sound quality and comfort that the Sennheiser CX300s provide. I have very sensitive ears (skin) in that hard earphones or earphones that fit too tight will cause my skin to break out and even infect. With the Sennheisers I can leave them in my ears for hours and not worry about pain and discomfort. They come with 3 different sizes of soft earbuds. The lanyard (wiring) is very tough and can take a lot of abuse. I have yet to damage any. As one person noted, they do tend to stick to certain clothing material but I have never had a problem using them while walking although I can see it being a problem if running. Maybe some sort of clip would hold the lanyard in place near the back of the neck or on the collar and keep the buds from coming out?

Comment:
These Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds are nice. The sound quality is very clean, open, and natural. I would describe the sound as "accurate". There is no artificial boost to lows or highs, just a nice nutral sound. The medium rubber ear adapters fit my ears fine. They go in easy and stay in fine for normal activity. They can come out if you move around agressively. The fit is nice enough to wear for several hours without discomfort. They do not provide a super high level of ambient noise blocking. I tried to use them while mowing the grass but too much mower noise gets past them. However, they have more than enough noise attenuation to use on a jet. The up-side is that you do retain some level of sound awareness from your surroundings when wearing these, perhaps a plus in many situations. These are made in China, as so many things are. The cord is very flexible, but tends to stick to things due to its rubbery texture. I am happy with these, not sure if they are worth $60, but they do their job well.

These headphones are simply beautiful. Once you get the proper fit, it is comfortable and it you get the best bass and sound. To see if you have the proper fit of all three sizes, put your finger on top of the headphone part when it's sticking in your ear. If you feel some of the earpiece, it is too big. If you don't it is the perfect size. Go from small to large. Anyways I'd say this headphones block out a lot of outside noise, which is really nice. I highly recommend these.

And, while they do sound great when you're lounging around, I don't recommend them for jogging. Because of the in-ear style, I heard every fall of the cord between steps as a thump in my ear. So, unless you're going to use them while exercising, they're definitely worth the money!

My first impression changed after these got a little time on them. . One reviewer said that they were great after break in. I agree and gave them an additional star after the break in I think they are very good. Excellent for the price. Another reviewer mentioned the annoying cord, I agree but if you run the right cord on the back of the neck it works fine. That's how it is supposed to route. Without the eq set on my notebook in itunes they could be a little muddy sounding on some overly warmed songs. I like to hear things loud at times and after rolling off some of the lows and a little adjustment here and there they are indeed very good. I tend to be ruff on them and if you are a little careless with handling, I wouldn't bother spending a lot more money just to get a better sound. If you lose or break them price wise they are easy to replace. I consider these comfortable, havin good noise cancellation and a great value.

These headphones sound great. They have good, strong bass & everything sounds clean. They block out noise pretty good, but not as good as the high-dollar active noise-canceling headphones (but, that's to be expected). On my set, if there is any pressure on the plug, I get static. It usually only happens when I'm adjusting/moving my mp3 player, so it's not a big problem. Counterfeits of these & other headphones are rampant on the web. The reviews from people complaining about sound quality & other things probably got some of these. Order directly from Amazon or one of their highly-regarded sellers & you shouldn't have any problems.

I bought these buds about a year ago and really liked them. Recently I also picked up a pair of V-Moda Vibes and even though they are very stylish, I found that the CX-300's are vastly more comfortable and are better at blocking out ambient noise. I honestly can't find anything to complain about given the amazing price; usually you would have to pay double for quality like this. If I had to nitpick though, I would prefer that they came with a few additional silicone caps since I lost one a while ago and until recently I was wearing two different sized caps. Still, after a whole year I'm loving these 'phones and they're still in like-new condition which is a testament to it's excellent build quality. Highly recommended.

I purchased this product to replace my 3 year old Sony EX51LPs due to a number of favorable internet reviews and the promise of better build quality to justify the higher price. So far, I haven't been disappointed. The overall sound isn't as bass-heavy as the Sony set but does indeed make middle and high frequencies clearer, so it's a matter of preference as to which you prefer. The fit into my ear is better, and it does appear to be much more durable. However, the biggest surprise is that these earbuds almost never tangle when I scrunch them into a carrying pouch (not supplied with these earphones) -- it always takes me a minute to untangle any other earphones, I didn't realize that this doesn't always need to happen! Thanks Sennheiser!

I tried a friend's V-Moda Vibe and found it all bass and nothing else. Liking the midrange clarity of my previous Sennheiser earbuds but needing more noise isolation (as well as a bit more bass) I opted for the CX300. After 3 weeks now I conclude that you need to oh so carefully insert the CX300 into your ears to get best response. Insert it "the wrong way" and there's no bass OR "the other way" no clarity. It's the Goldilocks of earbuds. I'm wearing it using the smallest of the three rubber inserts, so your mileage may vary if you use the other inserts. Even at its best, however, it doesn't offer the bass of the V-Moda. What I miss from the previous Sennheiser was the cord-located volume control. Because the noise isolation is decently effective, whenever someone talks to you there's no hearing that person unless you pull out -- not ideal when as mentioned you need to precisely insert the thing in the first place. A couple more inches of cord would be nice, but it's not a deal-breaker.

Besides the asymmetric of the cord, I can't pick out any negatives. Really hate this one side longer the other side shorter design. It took me a while to get used to the feeling when it's in my ears. I use it for my DIY 300B, 45, 71A, and 2A3 tube amps. It really gives excellent performance on each amp. You can tell right away which tube amp you are listening. That is, this is a great amp "monitor". 112db sensitivity, you are hearing more sounds from this bud---detailed sound. It's a bit too much bass for me.

This is the best pair of buds I have owned. It has exellent bass for what they are. There is very good definition and very little veiling. My only problem is that it does cut off the outside world where you will not hear anything going on around you.

Bought a pair on ebay for really cheap. Didn't expect that much but I am listening to jazz on the the radio of my MP3 player and enjoying it - this from a real audio snob and musician who probably wouldn't listen to the home stereos of 95% of the people who are reading this. I am really picky about the quality of sound and did not expect to use these except to ride my bike. The big draw back is the sound that comes through the movement of the wires so DON'T EXPECT TO USE THESE FOR RUNNING or maybe even walking (but I think this is true of all "in-ear" types - I spent $100 on a pair and tried to run in them - I sent them back the next day). I haven't tried them on my bike yet but the fact that I can sit here at the computer and enjoy the sound of the radio speaks very highly for the $16.(including shipping) that I paid for these.

It took me couple of minutes to adapt them to my ears and understanding that the right one must be turned behind your head (wires are asymmetrical).The suond is good on low,mids and high frequencies.Of course it also depends on what kind of player you use and on quality of the tracks too. I have a Creative Zen and it is excellent especially on the bass. They are my first earbuds and I must say it is a new feeling,you don't hear anything from outside because the isolation is pretty good and you feel music totally penetrating in your mind.At this price I think you won't find any better

I had used Sennheiser full size headphones in the past and have been happy with the performance. I have a Samsung YP-T7. The earbuds that came with the device were not very good. I thought I would try and get more from this device. I have been very impressed at the sound from these soundbuds. The bass is unbelievable. and the highs and midrange are just as impressive. I paid $54.00 with shipping. The normal retail was over $80.00. I would like to hear the competing Shure product but found they were way out of my price range.

The key to these in-ear phones is getting a good fit. As, other owners have mentioned, it is critical to find the right balance between comfort and sound quality. If you don't get a good seal, the phones will come loose and the audio will suffer. That said, they come with three size tips to try, and one of them should work for everyone. When they are snug in my ears, I really appreciate the sound quality. They are much better than cheap buds.

I would have given these headphones a four for the sound, but for the price tag at around fifty bucks I bumped it up to a five. I have a Creative Labs Muvo TX and an IPod Shuffle and I was looking for some better headphones than what came with the mp3 players for under one hundred dollars and the CX-300's were highly recommended. I bought them for $53 shipping included. At first I used the largest rubber adapters and the bass was lacking and the highs were a bit "tinny". Then I put on the medium size and the phones went in my ear a bit further, but sealed good. Wow, what a difference! Bass improved and the highs sound great. Both players sound significantly better. The equilizer on the Creative Labs helps even better. Very clear music and comfortable, too. I recommend these headphones if you don't want to spend over a hundred.

After using the earbuds supplied with my MP3 Player, I immediately recognized the need for something with more dynamic sound. The Sennheiser CX300-B(black) earbuds was the right choice. Once nestled comfortably in the ear canal, beautiful sounds followed. The bass, midrange, and treble was very distinct as was the voices of the singers. At 63 years old, I am not a "X" or "Me" Generation techophile, but I do recognize quality sound when I hear it. Nothing is more aggrivating that trying to listen to music when it sound as if it is coming over 2 Campbell soup cans and a string. Ordering from Amazon is easy and convenient. I have no complaints or issues with any of the items I have purchased thus far. Shipping was quick and all items arrived as promised with sufficient packaging to protect the contents. Overall, a good experience. I highly recommend Amazon to all.

These are great earbuds for the price. Use them right, and you'll get a well-balanced, and fairly isolated sound. Not too much bass, like all the Sony earbuds (all of them drown the sound with bass). If you use them for an mp3 player (like most will probably do), however, you will totally hear the flaws of compression. But I guess that shows just how good these are.

At first I found the bass a bit intimidating compared to my previous head phones which includes the standard iPod head phones, but when I changed from the medium fitting to the large ones, everything was fine. Makes me wanna re-transfer my music to my iPod in a higher bit rate :-) I'm clearly not a head phone expert and these are both the most expensive head phones I've ever owned and the best, so subjectively worth the price, and come on, compared to the price we pay for our mp3 players, this is a small investment to make it perfect. Bass is not perfect, but reasonably precise, and much, much better than any head phone I've ever heard. Also, compared to how much sound they block out they are pretty comfortable. Turn the sound down - with these you don't need it very loud.

These headphones are an inccredible value. I haven't tried any high quality earbuds like shure or etymotic but those guys charge more than my mp3 player cost! The sounds is clear and rich. I ride the subway everyday the rumble of the train is nearly non-existant. I dont even have to put the volume up high to get a full bodied sound so I actually get better battery life. They super comfortable and i can even fall asleep wearing them. Get rid of those "tinny" sounding headphones that come with your player and upgrade, you won't regret it.

After buying an iRiver Clix, and being bothered by background noise while commuting, I decided to invest more than my usual $15.00-$20.00 on earphones. Because I have small ear canals, regular earphones that come with the devices do not tend to fit at all. These come with comfortable, adjustable ear pieces and they were impressive at the post office, right out of the packaging . The bass is what I noticed first. Like Cnet reviews said, the bass is excellent. I then walked home via a well trafficked street to see how well the earphones block out noise. Again, they performed excellently. I've tried them while listening to Pop, Country, Traditional Blues, and Raggae. All good. If you do not adjust your Mp3 player the highs may seem tinny. But like I said, getting rid of that is a matter of adjusting your graphic equalizer. To me, $53.00 is a lot to spend on earphones, but I suspect I will take good care of these. Some of the reviewers are apparently use to very expensive earphones, but for those us us that just want a very good pair of earphones that do not break the bank, these earphones fit the bill.

When I first took this out of the box I was very dissapointed at the sound quality and the lack of bass. However, it turned out I was wearing the headphones wrong and did not give it a proper seal of my ear canal. I finally wore them right after a minute of being dissapointed and was BLOWN away by the bass from these $50 head phones. I wouldn't go as far as to say that they sound like "large amphitheather speakers" as some have, but I CAN say that for 50 bucks, this is definitely bang for your buck. I am using this with the second generation Ipod Nano because my old Ipod headphones broke and they didn't have ANY base, but the CX-300B DOES! Songs tested: Ice Cube - The *igga Trap The Killers - Bling (Confessions of a King) Ice Cube - Go to Church The Killers - Uncle Johnny The Killers were a better test for the headphones to test the most dynamic Pop music and they performed well as I could hear the notes I missed with my Ipod headphones but could get with my regular 5 speaker set up. Rap music lovers will appreciate these headphones as they can ACTUALLY produce bass and will not break your pocket.

I've been using the CX-300 for four months now, and I have to say I am very satisfied with it. It's a far cry from the earphones that came with my AV500. Lots of bass but not the cheap type. On the other hand, after only four months, the black rubber appears to have deteriorated. It's easily deformed. Otherwise, the sound is great.

After hearing horror stories about the Sony earphone cords falling apart, I bought the CX 300 instead. I did not hear any hum that some people reported (maybe it was their player? I use a Creative Muvo). It does a great job with sound isolation and is fairly comfortable (my ears are sensitive so like any in-ear phones, it takes getting used to). There is a slight jiggle noise when exercising - but this is only noticeable if you are listenting to really quiet music or a talk. If you are enjoying a lively toon, you will not hear it. A little more than what I'd like to pay for something so tiny, but hopefully worth it in the long run.

Header: COUNTERFEIT CX300 (it is a discontinued model), September 14, 2010
Comment:
Please DO NOT purchase the Sennheiser cx300. I am writing this to warn you. If you go to the official Sennheiser website, they note that the Sennheiser cx300 has been discontinued for years and seemingly legitimate online stores selling them are most likely counterfeit merchandise. Telltale signs that you have a counterfeit product: - Price: It is unrealistically cheap. $20 for a $70+ product. - Before opening your packages, look at the bottom of the plastic and it should say PET. Return immediately. - Sennheiser is a German product and made and distributed in Germany. It says Made In China on the counterfeit box. Return immediately. - Poor, muddy sound quality. No better than a pair of plastic headphones that came with my $2 plastic portable am/fm radio (trust me, I compared it with my fake CX300-ii headphones). I'm not sure why there are so many recently written positive reviews of this counterfeit merchandise. Most likely placebo effect. - Poorly constructed with cheap plastic material. There are also size discrepancies in the L plug and the quality of the earphone bag and plug covers but I won't go into this as I did not bother opening the package after examining the product box. Please check carefully before deciding to rip open your packages. I've been duped before with a counterfeit CX300-II model, which I still have lying around abandoned somewhere. I had done my research a little too late. I had hoped the CX300 would be different but apparently not. There are a lot of fake Sennheiser's going around. Do not make the same mistake I made. If you really want a Sennheiser, go to the official Sennheiser website where they have links to legitimate Sennheiser online dealers selling for around $50 for the CX300-ii models. Pay $30 more for the authentic earphones. There is a lot more information about this on the official website.

Comment:
I hope this is one of those "helpful reviews." I'm not going to sit here and bash these; I'm going to speak from the last two weeks of experience with these headphones. I've owned about four or five pairs of various in-ear headphones in the past (heavy user), and I tend to wear them down because I use them during my commute (on the train) and sometimes at work or at home. I use them quite a bit on a daily basis, and they tend to be in my pocket and moving around quite a bit... so yes, they will wear out. When the jack on my last pair of Ultimate Ears MetroFi 200 headphones finally frayed, I decided to buy these based on: 1. Quite a bit of reviews on Amazon and 2. The high review rating of 4 stars (at this time of writing) Wow, now I can see how peoples' judgement of headphones varies WILDLY based on their likes and dislikes. Myself... I can't stand these headphones. Also, the packaging is one of those "I need a butcher knife and a chainsaw to get these open" styles. No returns here; I'm stuck with them. Pros: - Um... decent fit in my ears. I don't have that issue usually. - 90-degree jack that works well with my Blackberry since the port is on the side. However, this may not appeal to those with an iPod. - Sound isolation is actually great. Cons: - Sound quality is terrible. Tinny, no bass whatsoever. Even the package says "Enhanced Bass." Yeah right. They're painful to listen to after some time... depends on your threshold. - The cord tangles ALL THE TIME. It's very thin and "springy." Incredibly annoying if you want to keep it in your pocket from time to time, or in a small pouch in, say, your backpack. - The earbuds themselves are very small and hard to insert into your ear. - The "cord noise" that you might hear when you're walking and the cord flops around is really annoying. - If the jack moves around only the slightest bit in the port of your device, you hear static. This was NOT a problem with my listening device (I tried other headphones and there was no fuzz/static sound) or other headphones... only these. Very annoying. I can't stress enough how bad the sound quality on these headphones is. Tinny, no bass... I'm looking for a little bit of "boom" when it comes to headphones, and I realize that little in-ear headphones can't provide as much as larger, over-the-head ones, but I travel and walk a lot with headphones in, so I don't want to have bulky stuff with me. Today, I wandered out and got a great deal on some MetroFi 220's at a local store. Stick with what works; that's how I'm going to deal with headphones moving forward. NOT recommended!!!

I bought these a week ago on Amazon. [...]. I had been using the stock Apple earbuds with my iPod. I wanted to upgrade. I use my iPod daily at the gym. They sound great WHEN they stay in place. The design of the cord is rediculasly stupid. [...]. Due to this major flaw they only get 3 stars from me. The problem is that the left ear phone holds all the weight of the entire cord. This causes it to constantly loose its snugness. As you may know that without the earphone fitting snug it looses all bass. Add in the fact that while working out your moving around alot and sweaty. Ill get some use out of these and move on. Had I known how the cord was I wouldnt have tried these even if they were free. They are probably decent for some one using them on an airplane. I am definetly bummed out with this purchase.

After some listening, my set of CX300-B in-ear headphones sounded extremely muddy and unbalanced - the left channel seemed to be about half the volume as the right. I got my meter out, and sure enough, the right channel had a dc resistance of 17.2 ohms, the left 27.8 ohms. That's a huge diffence in the two coil windings! No need to even get out the scope and signal generator. I don't understand how this was passed by their QC. These are junk, and I would think twice before buying another Sennheiser product.

Overpriced and second rate. They will work well if you've never owned a decent pair of headphones before, but it's a stretch to say that they measure up against generic ipod/iphone buds - they can't lay a finger on similarly priced over-ears such as the Koss Porta Pro. Highs sound tinny, mid-range is weak, and the bass is over-done. In addition, there is a noticeable hiss any time they are plugged into a device. Save your money.

Comment:
I purchased these earbuds about 5 or 6 months ago. I decided to overlook the flaws that many people had reported because the price was just too good. I now have buyer's remorse. When you are sitting down in a stationary position using these earbuds then the sound is great. Clear highs, lows and mids. The problem arises if you plan on using the headphones while performing any physical movement whatsoever. I mean, even standing up. The slightest movement transfers sound to the buds that is beyond annoying. Try walking down the hall with these in your ears and you hear a swooshing sound with every step. If the cord comes into contact with your person, or anything else for that matter, you get aggrevating loud sounds that drown out and destroy the quality of the music. I now use these earbuds ONLY when I plan on sitting down and NOT moving for an extended period of time. If you are studying at the library and need to block out other sounds then these buds will do the trick. If you have to get up from your spot at the library to find another book then be prepared to take off the buds. I just cannot in good conscious recommend these earbuds. I feel cheated by Sennheiser. It is shameful that an otherwise stellar brand would continue to market and sell such substandard merchandise.

Fit in my ear well enough to block out all other noise completely! They weren't kidding! I live in New York City and I can't hear anything other than the music when I'm wearing these - it's almost a little dangerous when crossing the street so be careful. I had to manually readjust the EQ in my ipod in accordance with the way the earphones fit - there are 3 sizes of sleeves. If it's on the big side, music will sound too bassy and if it's too small, it will sound too trebly. I used the smallest pair of earphone sleeves and turned up the bass. Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase.

Superb sound - but they must fit perfectly to get the bass response. I find it dificult to get a good fit - you must try the different sized seals to get the correct fit for your ear. I almost have to force them in my ear and they soon 'pop' out. Just used them on a plane and they are great at cutting out the background noise whilst allowing a superb sound quality. Because they are a closed in ear type they are not really suitable for anything other than sitting as you will find that every time you touch / rub the cord the sound will be heard in your ear. Also you can't sing with them on! Again you will find that all you hear is yourself over the music! Conclusion - very good sound when properly fitted but not really suited for music on the move. Beware - there are hundreds of these for sale on ebay and other such places - most of them are fakes.

Comment:
First off, the sound quality of these earbuds is indeed pretty good. However, the cord design totally offsets that value. From reading other reviews, it appears as though the right earbud cord is longer than the left so you can drape it behind your neck? I can't find anything on Sennheiser's site about it. But I'm not sure how this is supposed to be a good thing. It's very awkward. The cord material is very rubbery so there is a lot of friction and grab. If the cord is draped on my bare neck and I turn my head to the right, the rubber cord pulls against my neck and pulls the earbud out of my right ear. Just because of that alone, I'll probably stop using these. They're just a pain to use and are very awkward due to the different cord length.

For an extra $10 these headphones are much better than the Sony earbuds. The bass is great and the clarity of the midrange and highs are crystal clear. I like the behind the ear and short cord so it doesnt' snag like the two pair of Sony's I've previously bought which ripped out of my ears. These are very comfortable and stay in your ear with the right size rubber adapters. It is noise cancelling even outside with cars going by. There is nothing negative I can say about these headphones especially with a two year warranty.

They have an asymmetrical cord. Meaning, one bud is actually a shorter cord length than the other. While some may find this a feature, after only a few hours of use the shorter bud would keep falling out with normal use.

The CX 300B have very good reviews and were cheaper than the others and I didn't know how I was going to get on with in-ear canal headphones so I went for these. For obvious reasons this type of headphone can't be tried before buying so I had to rely on reviews of other users. I'm very pleased with these phones. They deliver an excellent sound - nice sweet treble, low coloration in the middles and good deep smooth and punchy bass. I turn off all the fancy equalization and mega-bass options on my (IAudio X5L) player. I haven't had problems in fitting them. One word of warning is that if they are pushed too far into your ear, I think the rubber seals bend over and seals the sound - this might explain some of the complaints I see in the other reviews. The noise isolation is reasonable - I can't hear anything else while listening to music. I haven't tried them on a plane yet. Update: You need to keep your ears clean when using phones of this type! Ear wax can easily enter the phones and block them (permanently). As a precaution, I started to use thin polymer kitchen food wrap (e.g. 'ClingFilm') over the wire meshes - the rubber ear plugs hold this in place. It protects the phones but I can't detect any significant loss in sound quality.

Strengths: sound, sound, sound! Weaknesses: noise transmitted thru cord and hearing yourself swallow. Summary: Great sound. depending on price might also try the creative ep-630. This like all buds of this style blocks outside noise allowing you to play them at a lower vol and still hear the music. This design also allows you to hear noises in your head more. This sounds strange but it bugs some people. Munching on chips sounds louder and you hear moving the cord across your shirt. If you are unsure of this go to the drug store and buy a set of cheap foam ear plugs. This will allow to hear the same affect to see if you can get used to it with out spending money on the phones first.

Header: Not recommended for NON-portable devices!!!, February 25, 2009
Comment:
I was hoping to use these for my computer or piano keyboard, but realized that this is horrible for those purposes. 1) Cable length: It does not say anywhere on the Amazon description or technical details of the product, but the cable length is 1 meter. That is about the length of the height of your desk. So if you're planning on plugging it into your computer that's on the ground, forget it. 2) Ear buds comfort: For those of you who are not used to wearing ear buds, be in for a surprise on how uncomfortable it is to have something stuck inside your ear for prolonged periods of time. And don't plan on moving much either, because they'll pop out your ear so easily. If you knock the wire a bit with your arms or turn your head too much, or if you decide to do a little stretch... they'll pop out. 3) Static and feedback from non-portable devices! I don't own an iPod nor iPhone nor portable MP3 player. Plugging it into my piano keyboard produces a lot of static like sound. Plugging it into my computer is even worst. Lots of static and strange noises get picked up. It's like the effect you get from some answering machines or speakers when you put your cell phone to close to it. Overall, not recommended for non-portable devices. I don't know how these earbuds fair on portable stuff like iPods, so maybe that's its only real purpose.

Comment:
I have breezed through 5 sets of inner-ear buds over the past 2 years, so when I purchased my latest ones (about a year ago, now), I went a little more expensive than I have been (I had been paying about $40 for the Sony in-ear buds). I'm glad I bought these earbuds. Aside from the crazy cord that is two different lengths (supposed to be helpful, but doesn't really do much for me), these earbuds have been the most reliable and durable of all (against griffin and sony). I'd recommend them if you are tired of one side of your sound going out after a few months or the cord fraying after a matter of weeks. (sorry for all my parentheticals)

I've just received these 1 hour ago and I've already asked for a returning label and expecting a full refund from Amazon. I'm comparing these with my 7 year old Sony MDR-W034 that came with a Sony Minidisc. (gone long ago because of malfunction but I kept the headphones) First of all, I'm a retired musician and have my years trained to perceive sound quality and nuances on sound. The good: The Sennheiser's are a perfect fit to my years, they are lightweight and the are pretty good on the noise canceling department, bass is tight and not overpowered. The bad: 1) The highs are TOO harsh to my trained year. (I don't want to be messing with Eq) 2) The mids are NOT right there where they should be. If you are replacing, say, a first generation iPod headphones, the Sennheiser's are an improvement, no doubt about that. I wish they would have worked for me, but they didn't.

I bought the Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds to wear under my ski cap on cold days and when cutting the grass instead of my Koss portaPro (over the ear) headphones. The reviews I read on the Sennheiser earbuds talked about hearing your footsteps, problems with the bass, and the J-cord static and style. I will address each problem below. I tried all 3 sizes (small, medium, large) and found the medium to work best for me. The large size had a good sound but were uncomfortable and would not stay in my ears. The small size made the music sound tinny. The medium size were comfortable to wear but did need to be pushed into your ears to get good sound quality. The J-cord was not a problem for me as I like wearing the cord around my neck instead of in-front (Y-cord). There was static when the left and right wires touched but that problem was easily resolved by tucking the right cord under my collar but will not work when I only wear a t-shirt in the summer. The biggest problem is the footsteps you hear while walking or running. I could hear my footsteps whether I was on grass or concrete especially when the music got low or was in-between songs. My friends who use Sony earbuds have not experienced this problem and have not reported the fraying problem. I cannot recommend these earbuds until the footsteps problem is corrected. If I had it to do over, I would pay less and buy the Sony's.

Comment:
I bought a pair of these to replace my aging Apple in-ear headphones (which wouldn't stay in my ears but they were sturdy) and when they arrived, I thought they were knockoffs. The construction is cheap and I'll be impressed if this pin-thin cord lasts more than six months. The sound is decent but not that impressive. The most annoying part is the way the cord hangs from the one ear down and over with the dangling bit leading to the other ear just sort of floating around instead of falling against your chest since it there's no weight to the cheap cord. Disappointing but not terrible.

Comment:
Well after messing with these for a week, I have to say that I'm satisfied with them. They provide the deep, rich bass that I like and are EXTREMELY comfortable. More so than the Sony EX-71SLs for some reason. I think it is because of the different materials that their tips are made of though they are interchangable. Since my EX-71SLs died, I couldn't really do a side-by-side comparison but I did my best to remember how the Sony's sounded. If my memory is correct, the Senns have even more powerful bass than the Sonys and the noise isolation is even better with the Senns. For the highs and the mids, I honestly did not hear much of a difference but I did notice some details in a few songs that I had no noticed before. Maybe this can be attributed to my poor memory of the Sony's performance but it could also be the superiority of the Senns. One big thing improvement from the Sonys is the build quality. The chord feels rubbery and causes a little friction when it rubs against something but that's a minor nit pick. I am confident that the chord on these will last longer than the chord on the Sonys. Another minor gripe about the chord is that it is shorter than I had anticipated. It is just perfect without any slack when I wear it under my shirt. Being a short, Asian kid, I'm fine with it but some taller people may find that it will be too short for under-the-shirt wearing. Another thing that I like is the styling of these over the Sonys. The brushed aluminum ring contrasts the black very well and gives the headphones a very contemporary styling. A perfect match for those with black Nanos and video iPods. I don't know why, but the silver metal shield inside also looks very cool. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. The sound quality is great but more detail could be heard. I guess that's what the Shures and Eytimotics are for. The Sennheiser CX300s are great value for money because they can perform and are stylish. For those who are not audiophiles and want to buy something cheaper, check out the Creative EP-630s. They look exactly the same as these but with a different plug, chord design (Y instead of J), and, of course, a different logo. All of this for around $30s. I've never used the Creatives but I've read that they have similar performance to the Senns.

I am by no way an audiophile but I had these earbuds for less than an hour before starting the return process. The earbuds sounded great but the cord is horrendous, the slightest movement of the cord near the plug and the sound would drop way down in volume, create loud static, or one of the earbuds would go completely off. The cord is so thin I can't imagine I simply got a bad pair so I'm going to try my luck with a different brand. Amazon was great with the return as always. Stear clear if you plan on moving at all while wearing these.

Comment:
This has been my most disappointing Amazon experience and I have purchased quite a bit from Amazon this past year. When I received the Sennheiser CX300-B earbuds, I immediately plugged them into my new 5G Nano. The music sounded distant. It was not placement of the buds in my ears. It has something to do with manufacture of the 3.5mm plug. When I moved it around or pressed it harder into the Nano, the buds occasionally played loudly (normally) instead of as though through a tin can. But it would not hold its position and the sound would revert to junk. When I tried Apple buds, the sound was full. I fully expected to return the headphones, but found Digital Media Source has a no return policy on headphones. When coupled with the $5.95 shipping fee, my total $30.94 investment was a total waste of money. I have no faith in Sennheiser (I remember their prior quality for over the ear headphones) and absolutely none in Digital Media Source. I am also disappointed that Amazon would include as a merchant an outfit with a no return policy. I'll have to return to a bricks and mortar store for further audio needs. I hate wasting money like that, though I will try to remedy the situation with a trip to Radio Shack for a replacement plug. What a hassle and mistake.

So... I bought these 3 days ago. And I was very much satisfied with them. However, the material that the cord is made with is REALLY flimsy/weak/cheap. The material seems to be simple rubber, without any coating or anything. I accidentally pulled on the cord very lightly by mistake, and the wires pulled off inside... useless now... and if you do get it... take 100% good care of it!

These earbuds strike me as borderline defective in that when you tap or jostle the cord while using the buds these sounds are magnified tenfold compared to my simple Sony earbuds or the standard earphones that come with the iPod. I'd describe the Sennheiser version as noise-promoting, not noise-blocking. If you have to sit as still as a statue to enjoy the sound quality offered by this headset, it's virtually worthless.

I bought these because I was tired of buying all these other earphones that would give me two or three months and then fail out of one ear or sometimes both, including Sony & Phillips, but mainly Sony. I use my earphones ALL THE TIME. I almost always go to sleep with them on and I toss and turn often. I had these model earphones for a little over six months with some pretty heavy use before one side finally gave out. They still lasted a lot longer than any other earphone I had before so I recommend them just for the durability itself.

Header: Good sound quality, but uncomfortable, December 19, 2008
Comment:
I was a Bose in-ear earbud user for about two years when they started to come apart. I looked into earbuds under $100 and saw favorable reviews of these. The sound quality is good - probably not quite as good as Bose, but of course much better than anything out of your standard MP3 player box. However, I find them very uncomfortable. They fit pretty far into year ear -- so much so that when you talk, it sounds much louder. (While they effectively cancel outside noise, they seem to amplify your own voice and your steps if you're walking, etc.) They are tough to listen to for long periods of time. I went on a 25 minute run and they were not comfortable at all for the high impact of running. Also - and this is VERY annoying - the right earbud is longer than the left one, ridiculously so. In any normal configuration, the left earbud is taut and the right earbud gives you all kinds of slack. The extra slack may make some kind of theoretical sense if your MP3 player is in your left pocket, but it's too much. It would be good if you were listening to the left earbud and the person sitting next to you on the plane were listening to the right earbud. Or if you have a five foot wide face. But otherwise this is just ridiculous.

I was looking for a deeper, crystal clearer sounding pair of head phones. I had been using JVC HA-FX34, and I thought they sounded great but I wanted to see if I could find something even better. Well these are not better. In fact they are a couple of notches worse for sound quality. The sound is muffled sounding, not very clear at all. I am using them with a 3G iphone. The only positive things I can say is that the volume is louder so you would get more battery life out of your player. The second positive is that the ear pieces are real flexible and fit nice in the ear canal. The cord is some what cheap looking and thin and then the end is at a 90 degree so it's cocked when you plug it in. I'm sure there is other people that love these things, but I'm really big into sound quality and it sounds like a pillow over the speakers with these. I put my JVC's in again and it was so much better. It would be like blurred vision and then putting your eye glasses on and you can see again. I will be putting the Sennheiser ones in the drawer.

Comment:
I don't know how many reviews I've read about the Sennheiser CX-300s on and off Amazon. So many of them said that these were great so I decided to give them a try. I bought them here for a steel of about 20 bucks! When I received them today I was so excited that I practically tore apart the packaging. I had had a pair of headphones from Sennheiser before so I never even thought about questioning their products. When I first used these to listen to music on my Creative Muvo TX FM, I was shocked at the poor quality of the sound! I then tried them on my iAudio X5 (a great mp3 player by the way), and I noticed the same high pitched treble sound, and hardly no bass. I immediately asked for a refund from the seller. However, later I tried them on again doubting if there would be any difference--but there was. I realized that I had been WEARING THEM WRONG, and I HAD THE WRONG SIZED SILICONE CUPS in initially. I used the large silicone cups because the other ones were not allowing much of a seal. SO, becareful when wearing them! It also takes some use to to put on the earbuds, but that could be because I've never worn ear-buds that went in so deep. For me, there is some discomfort, but they don't fall out. It kind of hurts when putting them in too because it feels like theres pressure squeezing against my eardrum at first because the seal is so tight. Once you get them in they're relatively comfortable. Now, onto the sound. I was expecting a deeper bass, but this is acceptable. The treble is also a little high for my taste but I guess that's just personal choice. It also depends on the quality of your music so keep that in mind. And yes, you WILL be able to hear yourself breath and move, but that's hardly a reason to call the product inferior (as some reviewers have). Expect that you will be able to hear yourself breath and move for ANY ear-canal headphones. I'm happy I got these for the low price, but I hardly think they are worth 90 dollars. So, for 20-30 bucks they are decent.

I purchased these headphones after the cord on my Sony MDR-EX71's disintegrated. The reviews for the Sennheiser seemed good and since I already own two high quality over the ear headphones from Senn (which I dearly love), I decided to give the ear buds try. Save your money and buy the Sony's if you are interested in a low price upgrade. The sound of the Sennheisers was mediocre at best. The bass was loud but had no depth. The mids were distorted and muddy, even when played with a HDCD & SACD. These were not worth the price, even on sale, so I took them back. If your the kind of guy that likes loud music without clarity and quality, then these are the headphones for you. They are one small step up from the headphones that came with my player. I guess Sennheiser makes excellent high end headphones but they should get out of the low end market. My recommendation is that if you want a pair of inexpensive good sounding headphones, the Sony EX71's are better sounding. Don't take my word, compare them for yourself.

Header: Outstanding Sound Quality and Ambient Noise Isolation, Once You Can Get a Seal, December 26, 2006
Comment:
I am a fan of the Sennheiser headphone sound, having long used the value-oriented MX500 ear buds for exercise and the PXC 250 noise-canceling headphones for airplane travel and the like. Headphones that are designed to go into the ear canal are a bit trickier, however. On this website and many others, you frequently see the odd review of an IE headphone in which the reviewer found the sound reproduction qualities to be terrible, lacking any bass and sounding tinny. Presumably, those reviews stem from the reviewer's failure to get the earbud into the ear canal and properly sealed. As Sennheiser puts it on the inside of the packaging for the CX300's: "The perceived sound quality and bass performance of the headphones depends to a large extent on the correct fit of the headphones in the ear." If you don't get the bud into the ear canal with an air-tight seal, you might as well be listening to a pair of tin cans with string attached. Given this, the adapters or gaskets that come with IE headphones are of paramount importance. Unfortunately for my ears, the CX300's come only with the Sony-style adapters, which I found difficult to use. After spending the better part of Christmas Day trying the different sized adapters (they were a Christmas present), and almost giving up entirely, I finally got a good seal with the largest adapters. When I did, the sound quality and isolation were outstanding, with plenty of bass. Three days on, and I have become quite adept at getting them in my ears with a good fit. Every once in a while they slip a bit, requiring adjustment to get a good seal again, but I have engaged in vigorous physical activity with them without significant problems (the wires are a bit flimsy and sound sensitive, but not prohibitively so). In sum, once I figured out how to get the earbuds properly sealed in my ear, the sound quality has been exceptional. My only disappointment is that the Sony-style adapters turned out to be difficult to use. Nevertheless, the CX300 is a great IE headphone and an exceptional value.

Comment:
I was looking for something better than the earbuds you find at BestBuy. Was impressed by several positive reviews but kept in mind the negative comments. Just received my pair and here are my feelings on these earbuds: Pros: * Very lightweight & comfortable fit, try the different size skirts for best fit * The rubber skirts do well to block out surrounding noise * Clear mid and high frequencies Cons * Cord noise - These are not earbuds for active use (no jogging). You will hear every little rustle against the cord. Just fine if you're just sitting or VERY low activity. (-1 star) * Low or distorted bass. Non-existant bass with a normal EQ setting, with my iPod's "Bass Booster" setting it simply becomes distorted. (-1 star) * No carrying case supplied. Even a small cloth pouch would have been nice. I'm wary of just throwing these in my backpack. Guess I'll ghetto it with a ziplock bag. Anyone know where you can get replacement skirts? I have a feeling these will wear out or tear after a few months of abuse. As mentioned many times, these are asymentrical (cord goes up to left ear, right earbud branches off). I don't know why people are complaining, read the description before purchase and you'd know about this. I prefer this design anyway. They aren't earbuds you'll be sharing with anyone since they go into your ear so deep (and will need regular cleaning). I'm happy with the earbuds for the price I paid ($48) but wouldn't pay list ($69) for them. For asthetic value, the all-black design looks fine and doesn't scream "iPod here!"

Header: Not for modern choons., March 14, 2006
Comment:
You have it this way - an excellently developed pair of canal phones that deserve distinguishment from the rest of the herd. They are loud, clear and usually comfortable. The cord is y-shaped and as such, is optimal behind the face. The length of the extending wire is quite adequate for most portable solutions and wraps well without maintaining a memory shape. It is soft and does grip well to other smooth surfaces so be wary if you move sharply. The phones themselves are very small. They take a bit of work to get into your ears if you have long hair like I do. They don't pop in as easily as say, the Panasonic RP-HJE50's do. However, once in they stay without much pain. For reference, I use the medium sized plugs. There is no stick extending from the housing so hold on to the ball-shaped part to plug in. The sound that comes out of these is quite impressive. I've had my run with cheap solutions and these certainly offer the most precise mid and upper ranges but are a bit anaemic in low bass tones. If you plan on hard, fast-hitting bass tunes, avoid these. They are perfect for ambient electronica, contemporary jazz, technical guitar/bass, etc. They most likely retain the "Sennheiser Sound." They don't butcher modern music but lack the excitement of other similarly priced canalphones, though. If you're looking to analyze your music cheaply, give these a go. I certainly wish they would provide a carrying bag for the frugal price to include one in the packaging. This is why they deserve four stars.

I bought these last year for myself for about twenty dollars. Now these are obviously much better than those crap headphones that come with an ipod. However I wouldn't say they have the greatest bass response. Its too bad they are like 40 bucks right now on amazon, so I can't really recommend them anymore. Good isolation, ok bass, mids and trebles very good. But for the price they are now, I would look elsewhere like Sony's inear headphones. Those supposedly have great bass.

I have owned this product for more than one year, and it still works as well as the first day it arrived. I use it everyday. It's great to know that now I won't have to worry about my earphones being broken or suddenly mute or anything like that, at least not for a long while. You won't be disappointed.

Header: Amazing sound quality but poor construction, November 14, 2010
Comment:
I have purchased these head phones about 6 months ago and I have to say these are the best sounding ear buds I've ever owned and I have tried many other brands ranging from $30 to $100 the sound quality is far better in the high to mid range but lacking slightly in bass. These produce nearly twice the volume as other ear buds and the sound is bright and clean. They are light weight and comfortable too and I can wear them for many hours unlike other ear buds that are uncomfortable. The only complaint I have is the wire construction. After about 3 months of moderate use the wires got a short in them and now they don't work correctly. I want to buy another pair but don't know if it's worth risking the same issue? Looking at the reviews of other models by Sennheiser this seems to be a general problem for most of their ear buds. Why can't Sennheiser engineers get it right and address this issue?

Comment:
Love these earbuds, but don't like the asymetric cord lengh. I wear these at work. I work next to a huge heating/airconditioning unit that is very loud. These earbuds fit nicely into my ears and really drop the external noise level. They sound great for music and podcasts. The only thing I don't like about these earbuds is the asymetrical cord lengh. I put my MP3 player into a holster on my belt, and not into a shirt pocket. I find the asymetric cord lengths annoying rather that helpful. Not a deal breaker, but still annoying.

I bought these after some random ear phones i had were constantly breaking on me and i figured i was spending more buying constant new earphones. So i decided to go online and buy these and now im glad because ive had them about a month and they have been great, with the volume about half way on my iPod you cant hear any outside noises and the sound is great. Not tinny or muffled like with my previous earphones (something that always bugged me) 9/10 in my opinion

Comment:
I got these on amazon and when i first played the sennheiser cx300 i was not impressed by the sound quality. I actually liked my iphone earphones just fine but wanted better bass. These earphones do have a lot better bass and blocks out outside noise very well. After playing for about an hour the sound actually sounds a lot better you have to get used to it. Listened to my earphones that came with the iphone and it sounded weak in bass and undetailed as the sennheiser. the only little problem with the sennheiser the tremble is a little too high at louder volumes. The high hats and the words theres a very strong tsss like the tremble is too high but im using an iphone 3gs with no Eq.

Header: Great sound but not a great chord style for my use., November 7, 2010
Comment:
The sound quality is good. The bass sounds awesome ecspecially for $25. I the headphones strictly for working out just so you know my reason for use. My only complaint has to do with the cord itself, and it is really more of my problem for not reading the full product description. THe J-cord or whatever it is called is horribly annoying. The length of the part that comes around behind your neck is way too long. The chord sticks out of your ear sideways just because of the design of the chord... looks very akward. I can actually see the chord out of my perifyle vision on my right. I also don't really like the ear buds. It is nice because you have the different sizes, but for some reason, I just can't get it to fit my ear well, which you need in order to get the full sound qaulitiy. Don't get me wrong I like them, but too much of my workout is now being consumed fiddling with the cord. So, love the sound just not the cord. If you can, order the regular cord I would go for that, but then again maybe its just how it fits on me.

Comment:
I haven't tried many heard phones. Comparing these to Jbuds and the Marshmallows, these are a lot better. I actually bought these online the same day i went to Best buy to get the Marshmallows (excuse me if i misspell it). i loved the Marshmallows, especially comparing them to Apple's HPs an jbuds. As I was waiting for the CX300 I thought I made a mistake. When my sennheider arrived i though, "Ok, I gotta at least give them a try." They were alot more comfortable than the Marshmallows. i could barely feel them. I compared all of my headphones and they were the loudest AND cleanest sound. The only bad thing is that they, like the other ones, are small. I lost them so I came back to buy some more. I also decided to write a comment because I am a very hesitant buyer and love reading reviews online. Get these.

Comment:
Pros. With an equalizer you can achieve great sounding highs and tons of bass that I didn't know IEMs could have. Great sound quality for the price in my opinion. Cons. These are very minor cons, but never the less, they exist. The cord length is pretty short. They have different length cords to each IEM, not sure what that is for. Although they stay in my ears better than earbuds when moving, they slowly slip a little, causing lots of bass to be lost, so I need to keep pushing them back in my ear, and the different sizes didn't fix this for me.

Comment:
Sound is great. Not a bad entry in the commodity level earbud market - very cost effective. My main negative is the use of a rubberized material covering the connecting wires. These wires are sticky and tend not to slide past each other easily and this promotes tangles in the wires that is annoying. Perhaps this will give the head set greater longevity but the tangled wires is a daily pain. The selection of several ear inserts assures a good ear fit and these earbuds are exceptionally good at muffling outside noise and isolating the sound. Great help on airplanes.

Was perfect for the price - I believe they were cheaper (only 24 when I bought) Durable - I have had these in my pocket and sat on them/crushed them against things/gotten them wet... and no problems. My only problem - the left ear cord is significantly shorter and tends to get pulled out of my ear easily. I have stopped running with these and went back to my over the head(Philips ShS5200-fantastic) But if you want high quality in-ear headphones without the high price (and are not planning on moving around too much when wearing them) then these are it.

Comment:
Overall a good earbud system. I have the same over the ear headset by Sennheiser and absolutely love it so I bought these. Two things i wish I had known: 1. It has the offset cords for each earbud (left and right), meaning one is longer than the other, I don't like that. 2. The overall cord is short and very flimsy. I have other earbuds for working-out where the cords are much sturdier. This one has been delegated to my work earbuds, however I had to get an extension cord to comfotably sit and still have the jack reash the PC headset jack. Sound is good but doesn't 'wow' you. Earbuds are very comfortable with the silicone peice, however I don't like the silicone for working out as it gets slick with sweat and tends to slip out. Fome are better for this use in my opinion. I would buy them again knowing the two limitations above and using them for office use as I am now.

Header: disappointing design features - not good for running, October 29, 2010
Comment:
I'm sorry this review is going to sound so negative - so I will start with the positive. These buds do have a good fit and better sound than the apple buds. However, the design of the buds leaves quite a bit to be desired. FIRST - the cord is asymmetric (left bud has a shorter cord than the right). I have no idea why they would do this, and it causes a tug on your left ear. Because of this design "flaw" there is no cinch adjuster to tighten the cord (as on the original apple buds) which I find very useful when running. SECOND - the "j" plug is another oddity. Again, I have to ask "why???". When using the Nike sensor, the j plug has to stick out perpendicular to your pod. This has the secondary effect of causing the connection to fade in and out as the plug jostles against your clothing. Very frustrating and annoying. THIRD - because of the cord's asymmetric design, I found it impossible to have the cord under my shirt. It kept getting yanked out of my left ear from the friction of rubbing against my shirt. This forces you to wear it on the outside of your clothing, where it flops around (annoying). The flopping and rubbing of the cord also translates into audible noise that you hear when the music/audio is not loud. My conclusion is that if you are NOT moving around, for example, if you are lounging on a couch, beach, etc, these headphones would be decent. If you want to wear them and do any sort of movement, you will be frustrated and disappointed.

Header: Unbalanced Response, October 28, 2010
Comment:
Sennheiser brands this item with the phrase "Bass-Driven Sound," which is accurate if your idea of "driven" is "total frequency domination at the expense of all melodic content." The lack of balance across the spectrum makes listening to anything other than bass-fluxed pop pointless; the volume levels necessary to hear upper-mids and treble from an itunes store m4a file is a virtual guarantee of eventual hearing loss. Really a very poor design, even at this price point where disposability rules. If you actually want to hear someone singing, take a pass on these.

... but for some reason my cord for the Left ear and cord for the Right ear are totally different lengths! The left one is much shorter! I can't imagine that they are ALL manufactured like this...but I thought it was rather strange. Luckily I usually keep my mp3 player in my left pocket anyways, so the cord length issue rarely is a problem (I only listening to my mp3 player while sitting on the NYC subway for the most part). Anyways, it's a small technicality...but could be a big no-no for some people. As far as comfort, sound-quality, and noise reduction, I actually found the earphones to be very comfortable. They sound great, and of course, are very affordable.

Comment:
It's a nice set of headphones if you only need them for a few weeks. The bass response is better than average but still leaves some clarity in the lows to be desired. The high end is also a little unclear overall but not bad compared to some lower end models. At first I thought I had got what I paid for, an upgrade from the current $15 set I had. It wasn't bad. It lasted about three weeks. The cord, which is a bit short anyway, got a short in it. It was horrible. The crackling and signal lose started about three weeks in then about three days later I was getting nothing. I walk about 6 miles a day and on these walks I like to listen to my ipod. Apparently that was too much stress on them. I am not rough with my gear. I was quite disappointed with the shoddy workmanship. I am back to my $15 pair of headphones and having no problem except they sound pretty bad when playing music. I will never spend less than $100 for headphones again. It cost you more in the end. You get what you pay for. Or in this case, you get less than you pay for.

Header: Great for Hip Hop but not enough clarity in mid to upper range., October 19, 2010
Comment:
I'm a musician with my own home studio. I have a lot of head phones, ear buds and over the ears. These boost the bass far too much for my taste. I really dislike the midrange and lack of upper clarity. I'm not using these professionally and obviously don't mix with headphones anyway. These are being used in my iTouch, and they are less than OK. I'm not big on Hip Hop but actually like bass boost but these boost the bass so much that it can get muddy even in alternative music. I dislike having to use the EQ to make these acceptable and I don't get a good reference for how the music is intended to sound, but then that's my observation as a home recording artist. On a positive note they are extremely comfortable. So for that reason alone they are worth keeping. They also do an excellent job of muting external noise. The cord is a little short for me and I'm only 5'11 1/2 with most of my height in my legs so they cord might be too short for some of you really tall people. I accidently bought two pair (my fault) and will be giving the other away as a present. I love the comfort but probably wouldn't buy these again.

Comment:
Hi, I bought these last year in November. I have used them for downhill mtb and I wear them inside my helmet. Sound quality is good and they fit very good inside my helmet. Very comfortable (I use the smallest replacement rubbers). This earbuds have taken a lot of beating, I have fallen off my bike and hit my head with the helmet in the ground a couple of times. One earpiece got off the earbud and I could screw it back and it worked perfectly (but it was my fault because I fell off my bike). They have lasted a little bit under a year under the rough conditions that my earbuds are exposed to ( sweat, falling of my bike, cords get pulled by branches sometimes ) The only problem that I have with these earbuds is that one cord is longer that the other one by approximately 5 inches. I don't know if that is normal but I didn't like it. I had to tape the cords so that it would have the same length and now there is a cord that stands out and it doesn't look or feel so nice. Please reply if somebody else had the same problem. And one more thing. When I bought these earbuds they were twelve dollars including shipping (bought from third party seller on amazon). Probably that's why I got one cord longer than the other one.

I liked the fit and price of these earphones, so I was stupid enough to buy another set after my first one broke. In my first pair, the wire split, making it impossible to hear out of one earbud, which I figured could be a fluke. Then, only TWO MONTHS into my second pair, one earbud has gone out again. There is no wire split and they look to be in good condition, but they're now useless. I'm very depressed that I can't find the original package in order to get my money back under warranty. I can only hope that no one will be stupid enough like me to pay for this product (twice).

Comment:
I ordered the Senneiser CX-300 Earbuds in the hope they would improve on the stock ones that came with my iPhone-4. In short, they don't. Specifically, I was looking for more bass. Several of the reviews I read mentioned the strength of the bass, and the manufacturer's website hyped them as "bass driven". Not only didn't they improve on bass, I think the overall sound is generally inferior to the stock earbuds. I did many side-by-side comparisons, tried the 3 different earbuds that came with the CX-300, tried it with the iPod bass-boost both on and off, made sure the jack was fully inserted, etc. It just didn't matter - the stock earbuds sounded better. I know these aren't expensive, but if you're looking for something to improve on the stock earbuds, these aren't it.

From the moment I turned my iPod on the left earbud was much quieter, to the point where it seems like nothing is coming out at all. Listening with one low and one loud sucks...it just makes you agitated...forget em, get the $30+ large headphones from Senheiser...they sound great and no volume disparity.

A week ago, if you had told me that for 20 bucks, I could get top of the line in-ear headphones that were noise cancelling and could be compared to $100 in-ears, I would have laughed in your face. These headphones have revolutionized how I listen to music. If you are still using the white apple headphones that come with their ipods, don't even hesitate to press "add to cart." However, nothing is perfect, and their are issues with these headphones. My number one issue is the design of the chord. It is designed so that the right earbud goes around your neck. This is annoying at first but easy to get used to. Another issue is the size of the chord. It is extremely thin. this may look cool, but it worries me into believing that they can easily break. This forces me to handle them with extreme care. Other than that, these headphones are top notch and are a steal for their price.

Header: good for the money, but..., October 12, 2010
Comment:
Having been through a few pairs of these, I prefer the earlier model (recent pairs have the same model # but aren't exactly the same). The sound is less balanced now... there's a bump in the mid bass which some will like. But for me, the sound quality isn't quite as good. Maybe they're fakes, I really can't say. Regardless, they are still very good, and a great value for the money - just not quite what they used to be IMHO. Today the right ear bud gave out for no apparent reason... nothing visually wrong with it, cord is in tact. I got about a year of heavy use out of them so that's acceptable for the price. The cord isn't particularly durable. I still have my first pair from a few years ago... I replaced them because the cord is semi shredded but both buds still work. Listening to them now, I still prefer the sound on these, it's not a dramatic difference but it is more balanced. A plus for these is that the size is perfect, they don't stick out of your ears very much at all. In the winter you can wear a beanie over them, no prob. Some other pairs stick out too much to do that comfortably. These are easily a step up from stock iPod buds and the like. I'm undecided on buying another pair of these or looking elsewhere.

Header: Cord Length is ridiculous, October 9, 2010
Comment:
I never post reviews and I'm not incredibly critical when it comes to products this cheap....that said the cord length is so awful that these are going straight in the garbage. The left earpiece cord length is about 6 inches - that's fine. The right ear cord is about a foot and a quarter - no exaggeration. I saw that these were rated highly on amazon so decided to give it a shot. I really regret not reading the one star reviews - which I usually skip - because I'd have $25 buck still in my pocket. Now I'm going to have to go out and buy another freaking pair of cheap headphones when I could've gotten decent ones for $50. If your thinking about buying these and don't mind a insane amount of cord drooping from your right ear, by all means go ahead, sound quality and comfort are both ok, but for me I couldn't handle right earpiece cord long enough to hang myself with.

These are very good headphones, considering cost and my usual roughness with them. The sound quality is quite good, when considering their price, and they don't look or feel flimsy like some others that I have ordered. My only real complaint is that the cord is a bit two short for my liking.

Comment:
These things are great. They sound great, the asymmetrical wires are very convenient, but most important for me is I can lay on my side and sleep with them on. I hardly can tell they are even there. With the other 4 pair of ear buds that I have tried they hurt my ear on the side I am laying and I can't sleep, but these are perfectly comfortable.

Comment:
After reading the reviews I bought these closed ear buds. Absolutely excellent sound blocking, I removed the default rubbers and put the larger ones on. With just half volume you can't hear a thing, no TV, no people talking. Awesome. The quality seems good though I haven't done any listening tests yet. Its definitely a different sound to open earphones, but that must be expected. EDIT: Loving these headphones. The isolation is phenomenal and I really enjoy them! Tip: Don't buy a crappy ipod. The only good thing about ipod is their marketing. Get a Sandisk Fuze or Clip+ and load Rockbox on it. Best MP3 player EVER!

Comment:
There are sellers selling fakes. So if you have a bad pair, check it's authenticity. I've been just using the stock ipod earbuds for years. I finally got frustrated after a few years. The rubber kept tearing off and fairly uncomfortable after a period of time. Sennheiser CX300s are great. The quality isn't great on my netbook, but it's because of the netbook audio specs. For someone who isn't an audiophile, these earbuds sound great with my ipod. Also the sound isolation is very helpful for a college student with 3 roommates and likes to study at home. I just turn on Pandora and they don't exist (if they make loud noises, then yes they are audible but not bothersome). I can't speak for durability. I keep them in a tin case so they aren't squished and whatnot. The wire noise isn't bothersome when you have volume up enough to not hear someone speaking to you -- which isn't too high. Very satisfied.

Header: odd cord lengths, October 5, 2010
Comment:
I had some Sennheiser earbuds before, and they were awesome! Braided wire on the cords, nice fit, etc. I thought I was buying more of the same with these. These were not the earbuds I was looking for. First of all, what retard likes the unequal length cords to the earphones? They tend to hang the weight of the whole ensemble on one ear, with the other earbud an afterthought draped across your chest from one side to the other. Other than that, they are fine. They have "normal" cords, not the braided wire ones I was looking for. So, if you get a good price on these, and you are aware of the "alternative" cord length, rock out. Otherwise, move on.

Header: Wouldn't stay in my ears, September 30, 2010
Comment:
I couldn't get these to consistently stay in my ears. I tried the different adapters, I tried wrapping one cord behind my neck (which the product is designed for with each earbud having a different length cord), but they just wouldn't stay. I also liked the sound in my Sony earbuds better - as other reviews have said, these have a lot of bass. If you're like me and have trouble with earbuds staying in your ears, these are not the answer. Try the Sony Mdr-Ed12Lp/Slv Budstyle Headphones instead.

Comment:
The sound quality on these is decent, but I can't stand using them due to an unbearably loud click noise they make when inserting them into my ears. I am not sure why, but if you press in on the buds it will make a click sound that is audible when in front of you but too loud when it is in your ear. I can't use them because of this.

These earphones are exactly what I've been looking for. I've always wanted a good sounding affordable set of earphones, and these are definitely it. I got mine for around 20 dollars and I've had them for about a month now. They are excellent. These are the best sounding earphones you will get for[...]. They sound better than earphones in the hundred dollar range that I've tried. They're very stylish and fit very well, the bass is just right and every sound is clear, what more can you ask for? Make sure you only buy them for sellers that have fulfillment from amazon, so you know you're getting the real thing. You won;t be disappointed.

These are fake knock-offs. Sennheiser doesn't list any of Amazons listed sellers as legit dealers. Couple that with the fact that these have less than stellar quality and it's quite obvious that they're knock-offs. Also Sennheisers MSRP on these on their website is like $80, with a few legit dealers selling for around $50. $20 is too good to be true. Don't buy these.

I've had these earbuds for about half a year, and so far they've been really great. The only thing I don't like about them is the difference in cord length between the right and left sides, but this isn't a huge problem. Sound quality in my opinion is truly excellent with definitely preeminence placed on the bass range, but that suits my listening style. Compared to the stock Apple earbuds, these are an improvement of several orders of magnitude!! Even though these do not have active noise cancelling, they seal tight enough into the ear canal to block most if not all external noise, which is sweet. Overall, I would definitely buy these again given the excellent sound quality especially at this price point.

Header: Good Sound - Great Sound Isolation, September 20, 2010
Comment:
Sound: The sound is quite good but not phenomenal. Considering the price, these are a good buy for the money. Sound is much better than the factory earbuds that came with my iPod. I feel this pair delivers significantly better noise isolation and slightly better sound quality than my Skullcandy earbuds that cost $18 a year ago. I first tried these out in my office and could not hear knocking on my door or relatively loud speech. My coworker had to come into the office into my line of sight to get my attention. I was listening to music with my volume at about 65% and was completely unaware anyone was at the door knocking or calling my name. Cord: I was surprised at the asymmetrical cord, and was initially unsure I would like it. I have since decided I prefer it to the typical symmetrical cord. I don't hear noise generated from cord movement. My only complaint is that I wish the cord was just slightly longer. I am tall with long arms, and I often carry my iPod in my purse. If the cord were slightly longer would fit me better. This is not a problem if I carry the ipod in my hand or in my armband. This also should not be a problem for those not "blessed" with monkey arms! :D Value: These are currently a better value than when I made my purchase. I was annoyed that the price dropped $5, almost 20%, just a couple days after my purchase, but that sort of thing happens. Comfort: The comfort is about equivalent to my Skullcandy earphones, leading me to believe most if not all silicone in-ear models at this price point are probably similar in comfort. These aren't uncomfortable, but I am aware they are in my ears. If I wore them for several hours, I would imagine they might become uncomfortable. However, I think for sessions of 6 hours or less they will be fine. I personally do not wear earphones beyond six hours at a time. Durability: I cannot yet comment on durability. I will update if I have problems. Overall: I am happy with my purchase. I had hoped for better sound, but I am unsure whether the sound I desire can be achieved with a digital music device.

Header: Not as good as I was expecting, September 17, 2010
Comment:
I own a pair of Sennheiser CX250's, which I love (and got at a great deal on amazon a year or so ago), so when I decided I needed a new pair of earbuds to keep at work, I immediately looked at the Sennheiser options. THe CX300s looked similar to the 250's but without the inline volume control (which I hardly use), had a higher model number, had pretty good reviews, and weren't over $30 bucks, so I figured I couldn't go wrong. Well, they disappoint. On my home computer, they were ok - only thing I noticed was some extra distortion when playing a low-bitrate mp3 - something I've never had a problem with. When I took them to work, whenever the sound was active there was a background hissing noise in the earbuds that would not go away or change in volume no matter what I tried. It wasn't overwhelming, but it was extremely annoying. My 250s do not have this issue unless you set the inline volume at max- and no headphones I've tried have this issue. I suspect the earbuds have a low impedance that picks up noise from certain sound cards, which tells me Sennheiser intends these earbuds to be as bottom-of-the-barrel as any other cheapo brand. Oh well, I just took my 250's to work and now use the 300's at home. I can hear the 300's hiss off my home computer but it is so tiny it doesn't bother me. Glad I was able to get by, but I am disappointed nonetheless.

Comment:
I've owned a pair of these CX300-B for almost 2 years now! Probably the longest any pair has ever lasted me. I'm a frequent business traveler, and my Sennheisers stay rolled up in my iPod carrier until I pull them out for a flight somewhere. Was afraid all that rolling and unrolling would cause a wire to break (as I assume had happened in all the other headsets I've had over the years). But seriously - 2 years of unfailing use. Besides the reliability/consistency of the product, the sound is really terrific. I listen to a pretty wide variety of music, and am a little fussy about hearing anything that sounds muffled or 'thumpy'. Also want to be able to clearly hear all the high range. So I'm always pleased at how clear my music sounds with the CX300-B. And they're comfortable! Probably one of the best features is the comfort. I can fly from coast to coast without even ever removing the headset. The in-ear 'cone' conforms perfectly to my ears (avg sized female with avg sized ears) - never experienced any discomfort. They apparently seal well enough that, even when typically listening to my music at high volume, my seatmate never hears my music at all. (Geez, I wish everyone on the plane was considerate enough to buy a pair like this!) If my pair broke today, I'd buy another without even thinking. The price today is lower than the original price I paid. No matter though - I'm getting my money's worth from them.

Comment:
I have never owned headphones that fit my ears this well. incredibly comfortable. I can wear them for hours and never feel any strain. These are most definitely bass-heavy headphones. I'm pretty amazed by how much bass comes out of these little guys. Some people have said that the bass kind of overpowers some of the mids, but i just played around with the EQ on my iPod until i found a setting that sounded nice and balanced to me. The only con i have is that the chord is pretty short. I'm a drummer and i use headphones live (Sennheiser HD205) so i was going to try these out, but the cable doesn't reach the mixer that i plug into. But for regular "iPod in the pocket" listening these things rule.

I lost my first pair before they broke or anything. When I bought my second pair, everyone in my family wanted me to get them a pair too, so I guess they also think they are a good value for the money. Definitely the best cost/benefit ratio for any earbuds.

Comment:
High marks on sound, looks, comfort. Low marks on usability for exercising or anything moving, really. When the cord rubs against anything, i.e., your shirt, it creates a deep sound to the earphone, interrupting the music that you're listening to. If you only intend to use this for when you're sitting down, lying down, or really just not moving, then it's fine. If you intend to use it while you're moving around, look elsewhere.

I was happy with my headphones and recently decided to call Sennheiser to see if they could check their authenticity. I left a message and a rep just called me back. He asked where I got them from, I told them a seller on Amazon, fulfilled by amazon. He told me they haven't produced CX 300's in 2 years (please note they still produce the CX 300 II) and that even if Amazon fulfilled the order they were most likely fake. I told him that they sounded good and everything looked real but he insisted that given the circumstances (price, seller, discontinued product) that they were almost definitely fake. I am going to return them and will be looking for other headphones. While I do think they sound pretty good for $17 I just can't justify keeping fake ones.

Header: Fantastic Earbuds for $20-$30, August 30, 2010
Comment:
I bought these through Amazon 2 years ago. I use them 5 days a week and have enjoyed them thoroughly. For two years of use they still work flawlessly and other than normal wear and tear inflicted by me, they are perfect. The sound and bass response is very crisp for such a small speaker. They are comfortable to wear and cancel out extra noise well. Like the other reviews state, if you rub the cord you can hear the friction in the headphones which is annoying but for sitting somewhere and reading or studying they are perfect. If it's super windy outside you can also hear the wind whistle through them. Occasionally I'll use these walking somewhere and can ignore the rubbing noise but I would not use these to workout or run with. I had never owned headphones with one end of the 'Y' split being longer than the other which weirded me out at first but after using them I actually think it works well. I gave 4 of 5 stars because of the rubbing noise. I knew this when I bought them but only planned to use them while studying/reading so this was not a deal breaker for me. Overall I would recommend these headphones if you are looking for a cheap earbud with fantastic sound quality. One last tip, if they don't sound great at first, make sure the music you are listening to is 192-320kbs quality. You can really notice the difference with these and some 128kbs tracks make these earbuds sound horrible, but fortunately it's an easy fix by ripping your CDs at a higher quality. Pros: Price Sound Quality Durability Sound Deadening Cons: Rubbing Noise From Cord

The sound quality is excellent with crisp highs, a solid midrange and strong bass. They are comfortable, look good, and provide decent sound isolation. The durability, however, is far below average. After light use, the left ear bud has stopped working completely unless I pinch the cord a certain way. The cord and connector are made of thin, cheap material that will break sooner or later. If you need durable headphones for everyday use, look elsewhere.

Comment:
I bought these to replace my cheap Apple ones that constantly fell out while I was running and hurt my ears when I wasn't. I was very impressed with the multiple sizes of ear pieces they came with and their sound. I have been running with them for almost a year now 5 days a week, sweaty and sometimes through water if a race has a sprinkler out. I'm not nice to my iPod or the earbuds and they get thrown in my gym bag or drawer when not in use (and abused while in use). That being said, they are starting to crackle a bit at the base where I plug into my iPod - I'm not doubting this is mainly my fault. I'm impressed with how well they have held up with the amount of use I've given them. The cord is a bit long and I have to run it through the back of my shirt, tuck the longer side of the ear cord in one shoulder of my sports bra and then the cord by the iPod gets tucked into my shorts. I'm okay with that (and FYI I'm 5'7"). Considering these aren't even "sport" headphones they are great and I'm buying another pair.

Was looking for an alternate pair of noise-canceling ear buds that fit snugly in my ears, with decent sound quality, for under $40. Saw these Sennheiser's for $35 (from BOOMDEALZ), quickly added them to my cart and placed my order. Had them for a few weeks now and am very pleased so far. When I first took them out of the box, I was surprised by how flimsy they were: unusually thin wire (that is definitely NOT tangle-free) and lightweight plastic ear buds. My initial response was to box them back up and return them (assuming they were counterfeit), but I hooked them up to my iPod and the sound was amazing! I currently have a pair of Dr. Dre buds and Shure buds, and the sound of these Sennheisers are just as good as those. And, the noise-canceling is great (they definitely pass the NYC subway test with flying colors). So when considering the sound quality, these buds are an excellent deal for the price. It seems that Sennheiser has opted to make good sound quality ear buds for an affordable price, and in order to do that they had to scrimp of the hardware. That's ok with me because it sure beats paying $170+ for Dre or Shure buds (even though they're built tougher and are better looking). But I'm a little concerned with the life expectancy of these Sennheisers. I'll just have to treat them with kid gloves.

Comment:
These earbuds are so comfortable, it's great! Normally with In-Ear earbuds when you touch them at the cord you can hear a loud noise that is transmitted through the cord directly into the ear; this is not the case with these. Jogging is so much fun cause you don't hear anything else than the music you listen to and as I said it doesn't matter if the cord is just hanging around, you won't hear this knocking on the cord. The packing of it is quite challenging. Each time I had to open it up I had work around 10 minutes until I got to the earbuds. When you finally got to the inside you will see that this time you spent was worth it. I already got my second pair of them, not because they broke but because a friend lost them. I would buy them at any time again, it's regular Sennheiser quality

The earpieces stayed on better than the Bose which constantly fell off.. The asymmetrical length of the cord to the earbuds meant to be worn over the shoulder takes some getting used to. I'm waiting to see how durable the phones are since I have been disappointed in the durability of the Bose. The cord tended to split at the connection to the plug. Overall, I am very satisfied so far.

Header: Yes they may be cheap knock-offs but they are cheap, August 9, 2010
Comment:
I have bought 3 pairs of the cheap knock-offs so far, two for me and one for my wife in a little over a year. My first pair crapped out after about 5 months but they still kind-of-worked so I used them until the right ear piece gave out completely (within 6 months of purchase). My wife uses her's much less then me and they are still working perfectly. My second pair is about 6 months old now and I use them about 10 hours a week at the gym and running. They take a beating and for the price I am happy with what I got. I would recommend them for the sound quality vs. price comparison. Yes they may break and that would suck but it is a good risk in my book.

I bought these to use at the gym and while walking in NYC. Sure they're not the finest on the market, and the fit does take a little getting used to, but they do seriously cut down the necessary volume, and they do so for a good price. I intend to buy a a second set for my husband.

Comment:
So I bought these earbuds b/c I lost my Sony ones, and b/c of the positive reviews on here re: sound quality. I admit to having a critical ear, but these earbuds are sorely lacking in this area. They're heavy on midrange and harsh, tinny highs, and almost no bass - contrary to many of the reviews here. My Sony pair wasn't expensive, but had far more range in sound than these things, including bass. The Sennheiser's sound like you're listening through small soda cans, to simplify it. The only positive I can give em is that they fit in the ear well, and are far better than the ridiculous earbuds that come with the iPods in fitment. Overall, unless you have zero concern re: sound quality and are satisfied w/ the sound of your stock iPod buds, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere.

Header: Great Earbuds when you want to shut-out the world., August 5, 2010
Comment:
These little buds are extremely comfortable, and flexible for all ear sizes with 3 different sets of cushions. I recently used them on a business trip to Italy and they were perfect for the long flights to shut-out the sound of the engines and crying babies. The sound quality is great and you forget you even have them in! It takes a little getting used to the different lengths on each bud, but it's not a game breaker. As for quality, they've lasted on the planes and trains so far without any issue. I don't necessarily take great care of them either. I simply stuff them back in the computer bag when I'm not using them and they are always ready to go immediately. Unless they break prematurely I'll probably stick with Sennheiser after this. My wife likes J-buds for their different colors, but I think the sound and bass quality out of the Senns are much better.

Header: Great sound, bad cord., July 31, 2010
Comment:
I bought these so I could have a set of earphones that sounded good and were comfortable enough to wear for a straight hour while I'm at the gym, nothing more, nothing less. When I first received them I was pretty excited. So I hooked them up to my MP3 player and started to check them out. If you get them in your ear just right they sound great, a little much on the bass though. On electronic based music (rap, techno, R&B, etc.) the bass is great, on instrument based music (rock, classical, etc) the bass is a little much. If you have a good player, you can adjust the bass but not all players allow that. My biggest gripe with these headphones is the cord splits and gives like 8 inches to go to your left ear and then like 16 inches to go to your right ear. I don't like the offset design but I understand that some do. Even so, what's with this huge difference in length? Unless your head is like 2 feet wide, the cable going over to your right ear will be dangling all limp and goofy looking. Also, the length to the end where the mini plug is is really too short for anyone my height. I'm 6'2" and I can't keep my MP3 player in my pocket because THE CORD IS TOO SHORT. So I have to place it in my waist band while I'm working out, which I guess works but is not ideal. I just gave them to my wife and she likes to use them with her laptop. Works great for her, sucks for me. Bottom line, THEY SOUND GREAT BUT IF YOU ARE 6 FOOT OR TALLER DO NOT BUY THESE.

Header: "Marginal" sound, July 30, 2010
Comment:
I bought these headphones because one of my iphone's earbuds stopped working. When I tried them at first I was impressed. The sound was much better than my Iphone's earphones. I have been them using them for one month. I'm not impressed with the cord - it's really cheap. Last night I listened to the same music on my Harman Kardon 730 Twin Powered with the Large Advents - this is vintage home stereo system from the 70s. I was overwhelmed at how much I'm missing with these headphones! In fact, I came to the comclusion that the only reason these sound "good" is because they fit in your ear canal, effectively transferring sound into your hear, as opposed to my old headphones. I'm going to listen to these less and listen to my vintage system more. Therefore, I think that the sound is "marginal." The bottom line is this: I was listening to $2 headphones that came with my phone (probably actual price to manufacture), and now I listen to $4 headphones (probably actual price to manufacture).... both are mediocre quality.

It is the first time I spend time on writing a review~my motivation came from this good item~I used several different headphone before, SONY, Shure, and Ultimate Ear. All of them are more expensive then this one, but the quality~I mean the pleasure I get from its sound, is much bigger than the earphones which are 3 times as expensive as it. I love it! If you can find a deal whose price is around 20, then go for it! It worth the money for sure. Another thing you need to be careful, the size of the ear plug~if you use the in-appropriate one, the sound effect will be weaken by it~so make sure you select the correct size earplug. there are three different sizes of ear plugs go together with the ear phone~so must be one suitable for you~ A truly good product~!

Header: Hearing Impaired? Love Podcasts?  This is the low-profile headphone to buy, July 24, 2010
Comment:
I'm an audiophile and webcaster who now has a moderate hearing impairment. I use headphones of a variety of kinds and price points to listen to TV, internet radio, and music, and I'm constantly hooked up to an ipod. Which is to say, I ask a lot of a pair of headphones, and I'm willing to pay for performance. To my ears, the CX 300 should be rated a 'best buy' for lovers of podcasts and other spoken word audio because it provides the biggest bang for the buck. The 'bang' in this case is just enough bass-like response to provide depth and dimensionality, and just enough treble to promote clarity without generating brittle sound artifacts in the upper register. In the near past, I've used JLab's JBuds J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earphones, which provide so much treble as to promote sibilence in places you would not suspect it exists; I've also used several different high-end, in-ear headphones from Shure, but whose impressive technical merits apply mostly to music-- not to spoken-word recordings. The only possible short-coming I can identify for the CX 300 is the light-weight cable, which does not drape as well as heavier cables and is thus more likely to flop around when you are walking and to produce 'cable' noise in your ears as a consequence. And finally, do note that these headphones use an asymmetric cable (which is shorter on one side than the other): that's great if you keep your ipod in your shirt pocket, but maybe not so great if you keep it in your pants pocket

Header: Potentially Great Headphones... Potential Only Goes So Far Though, July 22, 2010
Comment:
Like everyone else, I wanted to upgrade away from Apple headphones and I wanted some comfortable, great sounding earphones for running. Before I even gave the CX-300s a listen, I was very annoyed by the design which has the right ear cord 3 times longer than the left. I understand the feature, but I absolutely hate the way it feels hanging along side my face while I'm running. Even when I've tried to adapt by sticking the cord in my shirt collar, the first time I turn to look for a car before crossing the street, it pops out. The sound quality is above average, not stellar, but good for the price. Bass exists and sounds nice when the buds are deep in your ear. The issue there is, these don't stay firmly in your ear on a 2-3 mile run. They don't fall out (most of the time), but they feel like they might. Even then though, they sound fine. Here I am a year after purchasing the headphones, which have gained only moderate use over that time and the left earphone has gone defective. There is very minimal sound leaving the speaker and while both ear buds are in, it sounds completely dead. Combine this with my discomfort of their design and I can not recommend the Sennheiser CX-300 earphones.

When these are working, they work well. They appeared to be very sturdy. The wires, in fact, seemed a bit thick and tended to retain their shape, standing at strange angles instead of draping down.

Comment:
I have had these lovely earbuds for over a year now, and not a day goes by that they are not with me. Their sound quality is superior to the tens of other earbuds i have purchased; so much so, in fact, that under the same volume setting, these buds are actually louder than any headphones or earphones i have ever tried. That includes other high-quality in earbuds. All in all, they last, they're incredibly portable compared to headphones, and the sound is beautiful! PROS: - Cheap - Lasted for over a year - Passively cancel out noise. I comfortably use them in loud environments. - Sound quality - Sound quaility! CONS: - if you were to tap the wire, you can hear it in your ear. then again, maybe that's what makes the sound quality so great. not for jogging. They're >$30 and high quality. If you love music, do yourself a favor and buy them.

Comment:
I 'settled' on these earphones after looking at the reviews from other buyers and agree with most...the cord is a good length and considering the price range these have great bass and sound production for the price. My last two earphones were Sony and JVC in the same class and these are better. The only thing I do not like is the uneven length of cord (left ear shorter than right). Other than that, they are super comfortable and cancel out so much noise, I have had to turn down my volume (hadn't touched the levels in ages). They are also very hardy and have weathered quite a bit - its only been just over a month since I got them but if you knew me you would know that looking still like 'out the box' is an achievement for any earphones (I used up all my plug covers for the last one in under a year; they all broke and tore in my bag). I would recommend these earphones to anyone looking for very portable, good sound (but not over the top). They don't quite compare to my brother's Bose earbuds but they cost one sixth the price; and if you wanted any better sound quality you should probably go all the way and spend proper $$.

I am an everyman and I will keep this review short - the earbuds work great and it's recommended to those who want to try sennheisers before getting the newer brands, but I am saying not many will be disappointed for everyday use that is well above average.

Header: Great sound, not very durable, July 8, 2010
Comment:
I'm writing this review right after my earbuds crapped out on me. I bought them approximately 5 months ago and have been using them almost every day. Now one of the earbuds no longer produces sound properly (it seems like a connection issue, because it sometimes starts working randomly if I turn the jack around. Most of the time it just produces a lot of annoying static.) The problem is not with my ipod because I tested my earbuds with another ipod and the problem was still present. Similarly, I tested some good headphones on my ipod and it works fine. Now that I have to use the original ipod earbuds again, I'm reminded of how starkly better the sennheiser buds were. Maybe 5 months is their lifespan, but it doesn't seem very long for something that used to retail for 80 dollars. The ipod earbuds sound like a tin can, but at least they last longer (I've been using mine continuously for at least 2 years). Oh... and a tip for anyone buying these for the first time: superglue the rubber thing to the earbud. Otherwise, they WILL fall off and you WILL lose them.

Header: Excellent Ear Buds, June 30, 2010
Comment:
A quick review of these earbuds: I've had them for nearly two years and have zero complaints. They're holding up well. They're very comfortable and bass is very rich when they're seated in the ear canal properly. Sound isolation is also very good; my office-mates have to make visual contact with me to get my attention. There is some noise that comes in if you mess with the cords near your ears too much, but I don't think it's a huge deal. Due to the combination of a good seal and their efficiency, you don't have to turn these up very high to get good sound. The mids are slightly muted, but that can be fixed with an EQ. The highs are crisp without being harsh. Overall, these earbuds are incredible for the money, and I'll buy them again in a heartbeat. I imagine you'd have to spend over $100 before you got a set of buds that were significantly better than these. Such an upgrade is unjustifiable in my case, since I'm so satisfied with these. Small annoyance: The blister-pack packaging is ridiculous. Sidenote to amazon.com: I don't know how to rate this item's "Poop" under the list of attributes. The product is definitely not literal or figurative poop, but for the price, it could be "the **** "... A little clarification, please?

Header: Pretty good value, too much bass., June 23, 2010
Comment:
As one of the most subjective things out there, headphone reviews are almost completely useless. Here's what I can tell you that you can actually measure: 1. Heavy bass boost - you will have to EQ to taste. 2. This bass boost is excellent for some things like My Bloody Valentine or The Pixies, but is seriously overpowering in electronic and ambient music - EQ will help this. 3. They are cheap, but don't sound or look as cheap as they are. 4. The silicone earbuds fit other headphones. So I was able to give these to my wife with the small buds on and use the mediums to bring my Sony MDR-EX51 earbuds back to life (which are my absolute favorite value-priced earbuds out there.) Subjective notes - in a comparison to Sony MDR-EX51, I noticed these points: 1. Some more detailed sounds are lost in the heavy bass of the CX300 - but are fairly reproduced through the Sony MDR-EX51. 2. If you really like bass in the foreground, you'll love CX300. For bass that still feels strong, yet in the background where it belongs, get Sony MDR-EX51.

These ear buds are an inexpensive compromise at getting better quality sound from Ear buttons. The Bass is not very strong. Sound quality is acceptable. However, the lack of a carrying container or pouch, plus the fact that they are poor at eliminating external noise, such as airplane engine noise, makes them a poor choice for air travel.

Comment:
I have heard of this brand of headphones but haven't had the luck to find them anywhere, until i found them here at Amazon, for a very reasonable price, 25-30 dollars. Before these i owned a pair of Sony EX56 earbuds. The EX56 were some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever owned, but cost me more than $45 dollars at my local electronic store. These Cx300s are as comfortable as my old EX56s, but with better sound! The earbuds look great, very stylish, but most importantly the sound is great. At first i was disappointed because i felt that the left earbud was louder than the right. But i think i know why, the left earbud is focused on the main line audio, while the right is more of the "background" music/effects. This is more obvious when i rip my music ABOVE 198kbps, the sound quality increases drastically, and the Cx300s make it feel like a surround sound system in my ears!. I like almost everything about these earbuds, the sound is deeper, good bass, for those who listen o hip hip & rap/ dub/ rock/ metal/ or music with various levels of sounds, and/or instruments. The only thing i hated about these earbuds was the cord size. It has a very small cord, and since it has that "one earbud shorter than the other" design that forces you to put the right earbud behind your head, if you put your mp3 player in the right pocket, the cord is too small. Its too small period! When i bought these Cx300s i was mostly concern about whether or not they were the real thing. I recommend you buy them directly from Amazon or an Amazon partner that Amazon fulfills the shipping, this way you'll be sure you wont get a counterfeit product.

Before I start just let me add that I have owned, love and currently use Sennheiser headphones in my home. Not bashing the name. These earbuds do not have an awfully bad sound, IF you are sitting still. They do not stay in my ears, no matter which covers I put on them. And the cord transmits every little bump against your arm... into the buds. Which is very annoying. Abandoned them after a couple weeks. And bought a set of Griffins that work and sound great.

Comment:
This is probably the best noise canceling earbud you can buy. I used to take standard earbuds on the bus or train and could not hear my music or audiobook even if the volume is turned up all the way. This little guy is amazing. I only need to put the volume at 1/3 to 1/2 capacity and I can hear it very clearly. Even with audiobooks, I can hear every word. They are like earplugs with speakers built in. It tunes out babies crying, the roar of the train, people talking, etc. So wonderful! My only complaint would be the fact that the right earbud cable is about 12" longer than the left. According to Sennheiser's website, you are supposed to wear the right behind your neck, which minimizes cable in front of your body during physical activity. Seems kinda pointless to me. I have tried it this way, and decided that I prefer the cable in front of me, because I don't like the cable attached to the back of my neck while I'm sweating. It's kind of annoying.

My last set was a pair of Sony MDR's; the sound quality on both is comparable, however this pair is much more sturdy- the Sony's had frayed at the part where the earbud wires separate. I have two minor objections- the cord is just a bit short for my 5'10' height when I wish to put my mp3 player in my pockets; I usually end up using my breast pocket of my jacket. Also, while sturdy, the wires have a tendency to get a bit tangled. Overall, I still have no regrets about this purchase.

Comment:
I bought these earphones to replace the original Apple earbuds that were getting worn out from use. At first I was greatly disappointed with the sound quailty but learned through trial and error that I didn't have them deep enough in my ear canal. Once I got the proper fit, the sound was very good. I would't classify it as great, but sound quality is improved over the basic earbuds. These earphones are definately for general use, not they gym. If you are doing any active workout (I prefer kettlebell)they tend to pop out. All in all not bad, but if you are looking for something to wear while jogging or working out, you might consider sacrificing a bit of sound quality for a dedicated "sports" model.

I spent about 4-5 hours looking for just the right pair of ear buds. The reviews were mixed on everything. Thankfully I just made up my mind and choose the Sennheiser's. Now I'm no audiophile, but I know what good sound is. The bass is so deep, but the treble is still present. The price is excellent when looking for quality sound. The brand is reliable and the comfort and fit is just what you want. I've been looking for the perfect set of earbuds for years, I ended that search yesterday. You can't do better for this price... and to be honest if you paid more, I don't think you'd be doing much better.

I'm pretty picky about the headphones I wear, from a sound perspective. I absolutely hate the sound quality of the stock iPod headphones. These have a pretty good sound. They're not in the same category of the Shure headphones, but they're not $400, either. The different sized inserts are awesome. I jog with these and they stay put. I don't care too much for wire for the right earpiece being so much longer than the left, but given that they sound so much better than the other 10 pair of inexpensive headphones I have tried, I can tolerate that extra wire.

I've tried many sets of earbuds and these offer the best bang for your buck. They have the sound quality of earbuds that cost 2-3x these, and the durability is great so far. My main complaint is with the cord design- after the split in the cord- the right earbud has about 3x the length of the left. I know this is a design choice, but I prefer equal length cords.

Comment:
Before I review this product, I am usually not a fan of "in ear headphones" that goes into your ear such as this. This product changed my feeling on this kind of style because it does it well and it doesn't slip out of my ear like others I have tried. My first thought when I finally got through the packaging was that the ear cushions felt a little thin. After I put it in my ear, I can see that it does a great job of isolating outside noise because of the excellent design. I'm not an audiophile but I do love music to an extent. These headphones sound great and I do hear the bass response. Absolute deal.

Comment:
I am a poor med student and before that I was a poor undergrad so I haven't used one of those over $100 headphones, so these are going to be compared to other headphones in the same price range. I have used these for over a year now and I love them. They are very comfortable in my ear (my ears are small and the foam one didn't feel right in my ears) and don't fall out when I am in the gym doing either cardio or weights. And the base.....oh my god the base is awesome, I can literally feel thumping to my heart beats sometimes. I like them so much so that I bought another pair thinking I had lost my first one. I have rarely had headphone last this long before one ear goes out....so these are really good in that aspect. Only 2 problems which are very small considering everything else: The cords are asymmetric - sometime I would have like them to be symmetric...but its not too bad if I put it behind my head. I wish the length of the cord was a bit longer.

Header: Really Disappointed...BUT THERE IS A LIGHT OF HOPE, April 18, 2010
Comment:
Bought a Zune and picked up a set of these as the fatory set is lacking in sound quality. I replaced a Sony 4GB Walkman at home that came with a great set of headphones, but because they are noise cancelling the specialized plug would not fitin the new Zune. I was hopeful, but have to admit that these Sennheisers in this price range are truely lacking. I have ordered (another) set of headphones - this time a Sony MDREX85LP/BLK - they are by far superior to the Senns, especially in "tinniness" and bass response. Another option is the Sony MDR-XB40EX . I own ALOT of audio equipment (10K home theater, nice car audio systems, etc.) - probaly too much - and benchmark all fidelity against my Sony earbuds - I have to admit it but they truly are the pinnace of all audio I reference sound qualiy from. It is perfect sound. As far as these Senns - spend another $20 and get a set of mid-range Sony's - your ears will thank you many times over. It's an investment in yourself.

Header: Great Sound, Poor Durability, April 18, 2010
Comment:
These are probably the best sounding headphones I have ever heard. Amazing Bass, Clear highs, Great Mids. Nearly perfect sound. I checked and made sure I had the read ones, not some fakes. Last night the left bud ended up dying on me. I have been relatively careful with them in my daily use of them but they just crapped out... right at the 3.5mm connector. When i bought these I also bought a set of JBuds J2s and they were my work out headphones, the JBuds were $15, at the time of purchase my CX300s were on sale for 30+ shipping. The Jbuds dont sound remotely close to as good but are still working. So just something to think about in terms of quality and durability. Some cons I found with these, the super sticky cable, ends up tangling easy and can occasionally pull the headphone out; not a huge deal but is annoying when it does happen. The asymmetrical cords are a pain in the ass for me, make them terrible for working out in; but some people love it so its a preference thing. No case for them like the CX400 or CX500's, no big deal, would have been nice though. Some things that stood out for me as pros, the little silicone/rubber gummies that come with it, they fit amazing, much better than any others I have used. Way better than the JBuds ones, I like them better than my girl friends JVC with the foam buds. They just fit comfortably and stay in great while running if you get the cord to fit right and stay. The buds themselves are shaped great so its comfortable. Im 6'2" and I found the cord length great for me with my iPod Classic at my waist or my shuffle clipped on a belt loop or shirt end. Absolutely superb sound. I read a review that ranks their sound quality up there the the high end Shure and Klipsch IEM's. Iv never tried the Shure or Klipsch but I believe them, I was blown away by their sound quality. Other than those small gripes they are great. They seem more of a casual use headphone. I am a very active person so they just werent for me. At the price they are now I'd say they are well worth it just for listening to music. AMAZING sound quality, way better than any iPod or Zune headphones, any JVC, Skullcandy, Phillips, etc that youd find in a Best Buy or Walmart. So, I dont think I want to go through the hassle of trying to get a replacement set so I'm just going to buy another set of headphones, probably not another set of CX300, I may go with the CX400 MKII or some Ultimate Ears to try those out. Like I said, looking for something a bit more sturdy for my style. These would definitely get 4 or 5 stars if not for the poor durability with the tiny wires.

I would have to say, these are my favorite ear buds i have owned. They are light enough to stay in my ears. I had them in for about 3-4 hours last night. I thought they were extremely comfortable (for earbuds). They do have a very good sound. I settled on the smallest size of the fitters they came with. Believe me it does make a difference. if you have the wrong size in the sound lacks and they aren't as secure. I have heard complaints about the asymetrical cord, but the directions suggest to wrap the cord to the right bud around your ear. Honestly i usually dislike this style of cord, but putting it around the back of my neck is the way to go. I will probably after a little more time come to favor this style of cord. I like them more then skull candies i have owned sony's jvc's... the list goes on. Extremely satisfied. If you are looking for earbuds at a cheap price. GO WITH THESE!

Header: Good earphones only when it comes to particular music, April 14, 2010
Comment:
If you like a lot of bass then these earphones demonstrate some of the richest and most powerful bass i've heard to date. Unfortunately i'm not a huge fan of such pumped up base, so for me it can be a bit overpowering but to each their own. I personally find that these earphones aren't the best for rock either where you want most of your emphasis on the midrange frequencies. The sound isn't as rich as i'd like for guitar but on the other hand vocals are high range frequencies come out really well. Also listen to good quality music with these earphones to really experience the difference i.e. 320kbps + There is a tremendous difference especially in stereo sound for these earphones that make it sound particularly rich. Overall, not my favourite pair out there for rock music but if you listen to a lot of pop, you'll thoroughly enjoy these earphones.

Comment:
My office mate and I actually both bought a pair at the same time - and now we joke that people have to email us before they come in because we can't hear them. The sound is quite loud, and the sized rubber earbuds and that actually go IN your ear make them seriously noise cancelling. I would definitely NOT recommend these for outdoor running/walking/biking because they allow so little outside noise in. However, for the gym, the office, the library, etc, they are great. The sound quality is not concert quality but extremely good for mid-range headphones. Great buy for the price, just be warned that you will hear nothing from the outside world!

Much as I wanted to love these earbuds, they are more or less unwearable when you're walking anywhere. The cord is very nearly too short to tuck it underneath your shirt and then run it into your pocket, if there's any wind at all they create this obnoxious whistling noise when in your ear (like the wind makes when it's blowing really hard, except it doesn't need to blowing hard at all to make the noise in the earbuds), and the cord noise is almost unbearable unless you can keep it completely still and out of contact with any fabric. On the other hand, they're cheap and comfortable, and sitting still out of the wind (say on a bus) they do an ok job. Sound quality in situations like that is not bad, it's just when you get outside that it's absolutely wretched.

Comment:
When solidly in my ears the sound is muddy and muted, about the only thing that sounds good is rap and r&b music with heavy synth-bass/drums. The sound quality for everything else I've tried is passable at best. Granted they're better than the stuff that comes with devices, but not by a whole lot. My primary reason for looking for a new set of in-ear headphones was to use on the train where I need some level of sound-isolation to block out the fans and track noise. I listen to music about half the time and watch videos the other half. These seem to get the job done, above all else they do a decent job of blocking the ambient sound out. I also wanted something small and light that I can just throw in my bag. These seemed to fit the bill. I went back and forth between these, pretty cheap, and stuff that is much higher-end and decided these were cheap enough that I wouldn't have to worry/take care of them. All and all I'm not that disappointed in the purchase, they were cheap, but I got what I paid for.

Header: Excellent replacements for low-end earbuds on a budget, April 6, 2010
Comment:
Over the years I've used a bunch of different cheap earbuds, the last few I've used a modified set of Koss "The Plug" with some adjustments to the dampening, replaced the spongies with earplugs, etc.. I loved them honestly, and they were easy to maintain, just drill out a hole once a month and replace the foam dirt cheap. A bit boomy, but EQ could take care of that, but they got lost somehow. I finally decided it was time to spring for some decent buds, but I couldn't spend >$50 so I went with these. In reality I wish I'd went for the 400 or 500's but these are really great earbuds. I'm no audiophile, but I can hear a distinct difference in my music with these earbuds. I hear nuances I never noticed before, and the sound stage seems much wider, especially noticed this listening to some of my Pink Floyd which already utilized a lot of channel-specific instrumentation. These fit just great, don't fall out, they don't hurt.. I've even slept in them several times. I often have a lot of trouble with ear pain using earbuds, but these with the smallest bud fit just perfectly. The cord really should be a foot longer, as I have to be careful with where I put my Creative Zen MP3 player.. Just putting it in a pocket usually doesn't work if I'm moving around a lot. The rubbery cord doesn't bother me, although I have yanked a bud out once or twice because of the tackiness of the cabling but overall I like it and I understand it holds up better than the harder plastic cords. These won't do for replacing high end earbuds unless you want a good set that is more likely to get damaged, but they are a great upgrade from cheap earbuds. I love them, and hope they last. I can't get quite get the 'boom' out of them that I did out of my previous earbuds, but my old pair were admittedly boomy. I've read a few times that the fit affects this, but either the bud is in your ear canal or it isn't, I've fiddled around with different size buds and different positions and they all sound alike so I'm pretty sure I have them in my ear properly, these are my fourth pair of in-ear buds. Biggest complaints are really that they do not isolate sound as well as my old earbuds did, so doing loud activities I have to crank up the volume a little more. They do a pretty good job at it overall, but I got spoiled on my old earbuds basically silencing all external noise. And the cord noise is pretty bad, if I'm moving them around it is actually pretty loud and irritating, and not something I'd ever noticed on previous earbuds. Wind noise is obvious too, but turning up the volume a bit when in wind etc pretty much covers that up. BTW, mine were genuine, but I've read some reviews saying theirs were not. Amazon sells from a lot of vendors, so I'd google the issue and look at yours when you get them just to make sure. I've only had them about a month so I can't speak to durability, but the Poop quality of them is 5 stars. Seriously, why is there a rating for "Poop"?

There's nothing overly special about these earbuds. I was used to a previous similar style from Sony and these are basically the same. If you've never worn earbuds before, then of course these will be very different from anything that you are used to. The sound quality gets the job done and I would imagine is better than any cheap pair that comes with various electronic devices. Since these don't have noise canceling technology, you should expect the cheaper price...but since they are earbuds, they still block out extremely light noise and this is simply good enough for me! If you are looking to replace a damaged/lost pair of earbuds, then these would work for you depending upon what you had originally.

Comment:
I bought these back when there were $15+FS, so I know I got a good deal. They sounds good, and really isolate the outside noise. I actually bought 2 for an extra, but its been about 9months now and still no need for the second pair as these are lasting quite good. I use them 10-12hrs a day, everyday since I got them, and not one single prob. So the durability is great on these little critters. It is J shaped, which oddly enough seems weird as I did come from the Creative Y shaped IEM's. But didn't take long to get used to it and I sorta like it as I can leave 1 ear in and the other behind the neck so I don't have to worry about the cord pulling it off. I use it for PC gaming, I use it for music, and use it most for TV. All which I have no problems hearing anything that I need to hear, and no distortion. I can't say I'm a audiophile, but considering wearing big headphones all day isn't comfortable, I love these so much. I never get aches, half the time I have to get my hand to feel them in my ear to check if they are even in if I'm not listening to anything as they get so comfy I cant tell if they fall out :). I love being able to watch TV and if our yappy Chihuahua barks, I can pretty much drown it out with little volume needed so I dont blow out my ear-drums. 1 Downside is the cord is short, but since I had a 6ft extender, I had no problems with it being on the short side. It should come with an extension TBH, but even then, seeing as Amazon has 25ft cords for like 3-4bucks including shipping, its not that much of a negative. All-in-All, I was happy I purchased 2, and So far I cant stop saying how much I love em. Even at a higher price, they are pretty much worth it if your looking for IEMs.

Comment:
I bought these about 6 months ago and they have been good. They provide good clear sound with solid bass. I wanted to add a couple comments for those who haven't had buds like these before as I see many complaints from those who don't know what they are buying. First, these are ear canal type buds. They need to fit well in your ear to give good sound. Due to bone conduction, unlike your traditional buds that just hang in the ear lobe, these will transmit much more cable noise to your ear. This is how you also get the stronger bass though. I have found that you need to clip the cable to your shirt under the left ear to dampen these sounds when moving. They should come with a clip but almost no ear canal buds come with this. I have used one of those small clips that come with new socks to tag it to my shirt collar. That stops cable noise from being conducted up into the ear and improves the sound greatly when moving or walking. Second, I've seen some complaints about fakes. I got mine here from Amazon as the seller but many listings are being sold by Amazon partners where Amazon has no control over what they ship you. I'd recommend watching out for this as I think some of these partners are selling junk which ends up bad mouthing Sennheiser. There are definitely fakes out there. I have been in Bangkok and seen the shelves lined with fakes that are packaged to look real. So be careful which ones you order here. After 6 months of regular use I found one ear became muffled and the volume dropped. I've sent them back to service to be replaced. I see now that the price has almost doubled since when I got them. I think at the lower price they were a good deal and far better than the ones that came with my mp3 player but at $30+ I'm not sure these still have the value going for them. If they lasted longer I'd feel more sure but there does seem to be some quality issues. Edit: Just wanted to add I got an email today that Sennheiser is sending me replacements and according to the invoice they'll be "Mk II" versions. Sounds great to me since they seem to be selling for a lot more. I guess the CX-300 is being fazed out. Edit: Replacement ear buds just became muffled in right ear again. I've decided now that they don't seem to be able to make durable products. Even the MK II has crapped out and after only a couple months too. I really won't consider buying Sennheiser products in future. I've been forced to revert to my J-Buds - though not quite as crisp, at least they keep working.

I purchased these ear buds for about sixteen bucks. For that price the product is reasonable. The thing I dislike the most is the cable length. I really would have liked it to be an extra 2 feet longer. I can barely move if I have these things plugged into my laptop on a desk. The sound quality is better than most freebie ear buds.

Super comfortable. Couldn't tell they were even in my ear. Sound quality was good while they worked. Nice bass and could hear things I've never heard before with over the ear headphones or buds. I gave 2 stars because the right earbud stopped working on me last week while running. I read the reviews of this before I bought, but hoped it would not happen to me. I am not very happy at all. I can't believe they can't make earbuds that don't fail with light use.

Comment:
This product produced great sound and low cost only about $16.00 back in Sept 2009; however the earbud with the short lead failed to work after six month. I used it as my primary head phone set even though I have more expensive sets. I gave it 3 stars because I was very happy with it while it worked so much that I'm going to order another one hoping that it may have gotten damage when I was exercising. I'm going to try the Sennheiser CX300 Earbuds this time instead of the CX300-B basically because of the lower cost. Another reviewer stated that the "B" stands for black.

If you are like me and you have been listening to music on some cheap set of $10 headphones and are looking for a great upgrade at a good price, then these are your headphones. They sound fantastic. Great bass, mids, and treble. Also bought the Sony MDREX36V headphones recently, and, while those are a good upgrade too, the sound quality in these is noticeably better: louder, bassier, yet clearer. I am no audiophile, so maybe there are better ones out there, but if you aren't either don't bother shopping around too much. These things are great, and a steal for the price.

Makes MP3, lossless FLAC, DVD audio, and Bluray audio sound great for whenever you're on the go and unable to listen on a dedicated home theater receiver and speakers. Excellent clarity and great bass. This product shines if the source has a high bitrate (lossless audio like FLAC or similar or a soundtrack from a bluray SOUND GREAT). Lower bitrates still sound good, but one can distinguish the difference between a good audio source and a compressed format like MP3. The earbuds come with 3 different sizes to make sure it fits in the ear canal correctly. Overall, I'd say excellent sound quality out of these compared to any other earbuds I've ever heard.

Header: Great little earbuds, March 2, 2010
Comment:
I got these ear buds for $25, which I think was a really good deal, considering the great quality of these earbuds. At the retail price ($50?) it might be a bit too expensive. They're noise cancelling, so it's no problem draining out background noise. The bass isn't that strong but it was good enough for me, I could still hear my music crisp and clear. One cord is longer than the other. This is NORMAL and I feel like this design is better anyway. You wrap the longer cord (right side) behind your neck so you won't accidentally knock it over. It's probably attributed to my misuse of them, but these ear buds only lasted me a total of 5 months before it stopped malfunctioning. The thing is, I treated these as I did a pair of cheap $5 ear buds that lasted me over a year. So I'm not sure if the build is flimsy or what, but the sound quality of these ear buds for such a good price (when it's on sale) definitely overshadows its potential cons.

I somehow overlooked that when buying these earbuds and I think it's a critical piece of information. The left earbud has a cord length of about 12 inches and the right has a length double that. So unless you put your iPod in your left coat pocket, you're kinda screwed. I still give the earbuds 4 stars because the sound quality and noise reduction are great for the price. They can handle quite a bit of volume without blowing out.

Comment:
The ear buds sound great if I press them in tightly. Even with the smallest of the three sizes of rubber fittings, they don't really fit my ears correctly unless I press them in pretty tightly. That is not comfortable. These ear buds do not just sort of hang on like the stock Apple ear buds that come with Apple products, they actually need to go into the ear canal a little bit to help shut out external sounds. So, for comfort I gave them fewer stars. When pressed in, they sound great. The cord is plenty long enough. The right side of the cord is a bit longer than the left, on purpose, so the cord can be routed up the left side of your body and still be long enough to wrap around to the right side of your head. I guess some folks did not realize this.

These headphones fill the bill especially for 25.00$ They replaced sony ear buds which were 47.00 and they are constructed much better.

Read about these headphones in a Consumer Reports article. For the price I thought I would give them a try. While I like the sound, the cord is not very long. I also don't like the length of the right and left split from the main cord body either. While these are advertised as an "in ear" model, there is a hard piece which does come in contact with your ear and after using them for a while, my ear was irritated by it. I hope they'll adjust some of the features and I'll give this a perfect rating then.

I love them. Here is a quick run down. Sound Quality = Great! Comfort = Good...this is where I had an issue at first. They fit VERY far into the ear which was a bit disconcerting at first. Now that I'm used to it, I love it. They are pretty comfortable for a few hours. Of course, after a while having something shoved in your ear becomes uncomfortable. Noise Cancelling = Great. I even have trouble hearing people with just one of them in... Design = Great. I think they look really good. It took a little getting used to having the cord that wraps around behind your head cause I had never had a pair like that before. Price = Good, not too bad for the quality of the product.

Header: Not great for low volume, February 17, 2010
Comment:
For basic listening at moderate to high volumes, such as riding the train or walking around, these are great headphones. I've got a couple problems with them, though. The first is that the cord is designed so that every time you touch it or it bumps against something, you can hear it basically amplified in your ears. Also, (and this isn't really the fault of the headphones) don't wear a fleece jacket with these, because you will get static electricity in your ears, which is real weird and potentially dangerous. My biggest complaint is that there is a fairly high level of white background noise, and this covers up large parts of the music at low volumes, and sometimes even distorts it a bit. This makes classical and jazz listening very difficult. If you're mostly listening to rock and pop, though, they're alright.

Header: They sound good, but cord is a pain, February 17, 2010
Comment:
I have been using these buds for several months now. I find them to have a rich sound that provides a good balance of treble and bass. They don't seem to emphases either one. Which is what I want when listening; I would rather do any adjusting myself and have the buds neutral. These are the second pair of these that I have owned; the first one's went out after about 18 months. I use them a lot. They did not develop a short; the buds themselves quit working. I think that the 18 months they gave me was a good value. So I bought another pair to replace them. However, this second pair have different wire. It seems to be almost self tangling. It almost gets tangled by just setting them down. If I wind them up so they are not all spread out, they will always be a big tangled mess. Other buds that I have had have not had wire that is so springy and curly by it's nature. In conclusion, these buds have the sound and value. I just feel that wire should be of a softer less springy product. Just be aware of this fact, and realize that for the price, they provide great sound, and durability. At the cost of wire that is a general pain in the butt.

These buds have a good sound and fit well, but there is way too much cord noise. I got these to use on my mp3 player and Macbook Pro, but quickly found I can't use them with my mp3 player because of the annoying noise from the cable moving around. I also don't care for the different length going to each bud; it pulls too much on the shorter side. They do okay for using with the laptop since I'm sitting still when using, but I'll keep using my old Koss buds on my mp3 player.

just want to make this point clear. It produces heavy noise even when the cord is slightly touched (for example when your finger touches it or the cord moves against your clothing), so it's only for use when you don't stand or sit there totally still (for example on board a plane). Use when walking is not acceptable to me, not to mention exercise.

These are a nice pair of headphones. Only minor details take away from them, such as the somewhat thin ear pieces (I've soon replaced them with skullcandy equivalents). If you plan on keeping your music player in your right pocket, I would also advice that you invest into an audio cable extender unless you're prepared to have the ear buds backwards. All in all these aren't bad, considering that they've been far friendlier than other pairs.

This company always makes great products, this is our third purchase of thier products. One thing you must do, to get great sound is to allow for the two day "break in" period, ay first I tried these on and was not overly impressed, did a little research and read about the "break in" period, I took the earbuds and plugged in my Zune, set it to shuffle all, allowed to play all day for two days (charged Zune at night) and tried them out the following day and WOW !! Great bass, vocals are clear. Only complaint I have is that they are small, really small, they fit well in the ear, just never owned any so small, that being said, it is amazing that they get that kind of sound out of something so small.

Comment:
I needed to replace my disintegrating Sony Fontopia 51's, and I bought these and the Jbuds J2's b/c I was torn b/w the 2 after all my research. The J2's were too bulky for me, and didn't fit right - so I gave them to my dad. I didn't listen to them long enough to even comment on the audio quality - they simply didn't fit me, so they were a no-go. The CX-300's are a touch larger than my old Sony's, and perhaps lack a little sound quality when comparing them side-by-side (bass seemed a tad better on the Sony's), but overall I am very happy with them. They have low resistance, which means your player doesn't have to work as hard to drive them. I would say they are about twice as loud at the same volume level as my Sony's. This low resistance helps save some battery life, b/c I can turn down the volume. They seem very durable, and think they will be the last pair I buy for many years! I do a LOT of research, and I think these are the best value, hence the 5 stars.

The thing you have to know about these ear buds is that it fits like ear plugs. I ride the trains and there have been ZERO ear buds that could cancel out the loud noise. Not until I got these. The one thing that's annoying is the cord noise when it hits my jacket as I'm walking. The cord length is fine, but it would've been perfect another half a foot more. There's a nice bass sound to this and not a noisy distorted one at that. This so far has been the best ear buds I've ever owned. It definitely beats the headphones that comes with the ipod touch. I just recommend that people be aware of their surroundings as these will definitely block a lot of noise.

The bass is great and if you turn it up really loud, I'm sure you could make your ears bleed. Though I don't recommend that. ;) It does a great job of blocking out external noise too. I've worn these at the office and was startled when someone walked up to my desk and I didn't notice them, lol. Also, it keeps the sound with you... so others don't hear it.

PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE LONG CORD FOR THE RIGHT EARPHONE GOES AROUND THE BACK OF YOUR NECK. Otherwise, the asymmetrical cord length will seem odd and a bit uncomfortable. Worn correctly, the around-the-back-of-the-neck design is much more comfortable and practical.

Like other reviewers here, I had a very positive experience with these earbuds, until one of the ears dropped to about 20% output after only having them for 3 months. Prior to that, they sounded great, and really blocked out external sounds quite well (to the point where I couldn't really hear someone talking to me if I had them in, even if I wasn't playing music at the time). The cord could be a little longer to make them more convenient to use. Overall, though, I have to give them a low rating because they crapped out on me after such a short amount of time (and I took good care of them, didn't yank them around, etc.).

These are the most comfortable and best-sounding earbuds I have ever owned. (Not that I have bought anything special in the past.) They are almost comfortable enough to sleep in, and the sound is a noticeable improvement over other earbuds. At the health club I notice that I can use a lower volume setting on my MP3 player because the earbuds shut out the noise. Best of all, when I go on bus trips with my ski club I have stopped using my noise-canceling headphones because I can hear just as well with these earbuds. I listen mostly to classical music, so I need the sound isolation to hear the quieter parts in a noisy environment.

In order to get the proper sound and isolation, you need to put them all the way into your ear. Unfortunately, this causes every movement of the cord to carry into your ears as well. While I understand the asymmetrical or L-shaped cord is meant to have its advantages, I guess I'm a creature of habit and still can't get used to it. At first I even thought it was a manufacturing defect, until I read about it online. I've had these for several months and I'm still more comfortable with the cords leading to the ears being the same length. In the end, the sound is better than the standard iPod earphones and the noise isolation is nice, but the cord noise and asymmetrical design is just too bothersome for me.

I bought these for my son last year and my daughter asked for a pair this year because she liked them so much. The sound is very balanced without too much bass... we all feel it's just right. That's pretty subjective but that's our story and we're sticking with it. These buds are very popular for good reason.

Header: A perfect mate for your iPOD touch 3G, January 22, 2010
Comment:
I bought this product recently and pretty much in love with it. Its a perfect mate for my iPOD touch 3G. The Audio quality is simply awesome. The low end and high end notes are just perfect. The Bass effect is commendable. Initially when i tried them, i was pretty much disappointed as i couldn't feel the bass at all. But then i read in one of the reviews that suggested - you won't get it till the silicon ear tips blocks your ear canal completely. This is when i tried the biggest silicon ear tip and that did the magic. With this pair i don't need to push these ear buds deep inside my ear canal and are very comfortable to wear. This is a true value for money. Btw these earbuds don't come with a mic.

These were highly rated somewhere, so I bought and they sound great. However, the cord got out of balance where the split between the two buds is, and one is now longer than the other. Not a big deal, still works fine, but looks a little funny.

Comment:
I love these! And at the super discounted price its a no brainer if you need a set of decent in ear headphones to use and not worry about. I have a couple pair of REALLY nice high end headphones (Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 5 Pro and Sleek Audio SA 1's). These sound about 70% as good as either of those, and they have a ton of bass. The sound quality won't blow you away, but they are great for out doors, exercise and the like. Also if you are on a budget and want a good set of head phones get these then maybe save for a super nice pair later. They are all day comfortable. I have a super hard time finding a set of in ear headphones that work for me. I have fairly small hears. These fit the bill perfect. They come with different size ear tips as well to get your fit just right. My only real complaint is that they dont go very deep into your ear canal, there for they do let in a decent amount of outside noise. I find myself running the volume a little louter on my iPod when I use these. Overall, these are a definite recommendation!!!

Header: Affordable; Great sound; Wire is a bit thin, January 14, 2010
Comment:
1. The right side is purposely longer than the left so you can pass the right side around the back of your neck. I did not know this in the beginning. 2. The sound quality was great. It blocks out outside noise; do not use while driving and be careful when crossing the street with these. I didn't hear a car horn once. 3. As with my previous earbuds I noticed a slight crackle in sound about a month after use which I believe was wear of the very thin wire near the jack. My previous set of earbuds (bass freq, another brand) had this same problem and eventually stopped working altogether. So as soon as I heard that familiar crackle I added a piece of duct tape to stabilize the wire near the jack so it wouldn't wear from bending when I put it in my pocket. Six months later it works great!

These are a great pair of ear buds, super sound, good fit and a price that can not be beat. The only downside is the offset leads to ear buds from the main cord. This creates an uneven "pull" on the shorter lead causing one bud to tend to pull out of the ear. If not for that I would have given it all five stars-exept for the poop rateing, what the hell is that anyway?

Header: Great Until the Right Channel Died, January 1, 2010
Comment:
These earbuds were great until they broke, which only took two months and no abuse. They isolate sound incredibly well--perhaps too well in some situations. The cord length is also almost ideal for me as a 6' tall person, though I could do with maybe an extra inch in some circumstances. The adjustable earpieces are great. Really, the only problem I have with these earbuds is that they broke for no reason. I started to notice that the right channel of my music was a little weak about a week ago. I thought maybe I was hearing things and didn't think much of it. However, some time during a 7 day span, the "weak" channel turned into a nonexistent channel. I know it's these earbuds because I tried a different set of headphones and they worked fine. I also don't bang up my stuff or listen to my music at high volumes. I'm not sure what would cause that sort of decay in performance. Anyway, the earbuds are now broken and I've flushed some money down the toilet. I'm going to look at another brand for my next pair.

Things like light cymbal work, being able to totally distinguish between various instruments. Excellent value for the money if you use your IPod or MP3 player frequently.

Comment:
The Sennheiser earbud headset is a top notch product. I ordered that item and the Creative Labs EP630 together to compare, and the difference is night and day. The Sennheiser sound crisp and clear. The Creative Labs earbuds sound washed out. Both are new so no burn-in has been done. The price was almost the same for the two. Previously, I owned the Etymotic Research ER6i. That was also an excellent earbud headset; however, it costs nearly three times as much as the two mentioned so it's not fair to compare.

I purchased these earbuds after a lot of research online. I have had them for 5 days now and used them on my recent car trip. I have to say that the sound is excellent, its amazing how different they are than the earbuds that came with my iPhone (yes these do work with the 1st generation iPhone!). So far I haven't had any problems, the shorter lenght for the left earbud hasn't caused me any discomfort. I do get some of the cord feedback if I knock the cord. I read some of the negative reviews about the headphones and I wonder if those individuals were unfortunate enough to recieve counterfit items. I will update my review in the future if necesary, but so far so good! Please note that DMS is not an authorized seller for Sennheiser products so if the warranty is important to you, the Sennheiser website states that they may not honor the warranty. However, my experience with DMS was great and the earbuds are fantastic for the $$ (better than my husband's Skull Candy Smokin' buds)

It is an okay earbuds, considering its $19.99 price. But unfortunately, the major downside is its sound quality. I didn't have very high expectation on this earbuds but I assumed it should perform at least better than my Blackberry 9700 Bold's headset. However, the short answer is NO, not much. This earbud performs good on bass range (again, considering the price, actually, not that ample) but has some problem on mid to high tone, rendering quite harsh, easy showing "hissing" effect sometimes (I listen CD, APE/FLAC or at least 320K AAC/MP3 so that the source is absolutely not the problem). Overall, a little disappointed.

Comment:
While these are okay for the most part, they are not appreciably better sounding than the buds which came with my Sony Walkman E436F. They do seem to do a good job blocking ambient sound. That said, I would like to state for all of the ear-bud manufacturers out there, that I will NEVER, EVER AGAIN buy this design of ear-buds. For starters, the wire that runs from the left bud of the CX-300 to the player is rather short. As a result it pulls unduly on the left bud. Also, the wire that goes from the left to the right bud on the CX-300 is extremely thin, and that length of wire is too long, which ends up mostly on the left side of the neck while pulling excessively on the right bud. And because the wire is so thin, anything that rubs against it, (a towel at the gym, a collar on a robe or fleece), makes an awful racket. What good are specs, when all you can hear are swooshing sounds? I'm back in the market.

Header: Most bang for your buck, from an audiophile., December 19, 2009
Comment:
I am a three year audiophile, running a rockboxed Sansa Clip and Clip + with a Fiio E5 amp and FLAC audio files. I traditionally use the Sennheiser PX100 headphones, as I enjoy the open-air setup. I havent had any quality in ear monitors prior to the CX300s. My only point of reference are the Skullcandy Inkd buds, which I will now never go back to after hearing these. The sound in the CX300s are gorgeous. The highs are a bit toned down, and the bass is a bit overpowering, but with the right equalizer modifications the range is balanced out. They are quite similar in sound to the PX100s, though I think I prefer the CX300s only because I dont have to drive them as much, as in turn up the volume. The build quality is also nice. The housing feels solid yet smooth, and is very eye catching. The cord, however, is like the Inkd's cord. It is a soft type of rubber, and thus catches quite a bit on clothing and such. The silicone eartips are of high quality and seem durable. Overall, whether youre an audiophile or enjoy music, these are great in ear monitors.

This is a great product. Its basically what you would expect from a pair of $20 headphones. Not Bose quality, but also not the crap that they send you with your I-pod.

If you are buying these for any regular 3.5mm device (i pod, I phone, laptops, portable dvd players, really about anything with a headphone jack) the headphones are a great product for the money.

The good Sound quality is definitely some of the best i've heard from earbuds in a long time. These may be bass driven but it's not overwhelming or ridiculous, actually it allows for more control from the EQ settings from the device you use the earbuds with. The cord doesn't seem cheap or like it will fray any time soon, i also like the "L" shaped jack plug, nice touch that keeps the jack wires from bending unnecessarily. The bad Cord length could be a wee bit longer and I HATE when companies make the right ear piece cord longer than the left.

Comment:
Pros: Very light and stylish. Fits very nicely (Has three buds, i use smallest). I like the asymmetrical cord. Low price (I paid $18 shipped). Cons: Where do I start? Bass is good but voice and high notes sound muffled. Mid-range and high-range lack clarity. 300 CX are much more comfortable to wear but sound quality is no better than stock buds i got with my Zune, probably worse as I care more about mid-range than bass. Also the cord transmits rubbing / friction noises easily - especially noticeable when volume is low and/or you are running. Other Thoughts: Maybe I just got a bad pair, but I expected better from a company with such a reputation, even for a low end model.

Comment:
Bearing in mind that I've had this set for only a couple of months, so far it's been a great purchase. Last year I purchased the Sony MDREX36V Earbud Headphone (my first earbuds) and was ultimately so disappointed in the design (discomfort, no size to properly fit my ear, sound was so/so, earbuds popped off too easily) that I thought twice about making that investment again. Needless to say, the differences in comfort and sound quality were apparent right from the start. My only complaint is that I'm not too keen on the longer right-side vs the left-side concept. It's not terrible but does make putting it in the right pocket a little tight. Only other minor complaint so far is that I wish the cord was longer in general. This purchase hasn't been time-tested, so I will update if necessary.

I've had some bad experiences with earbuds and headphones in general and was skeptical of these. I bought them because they were recommended to me, and besides having extreme difficult opening the package, I've only had good things to say about these. I used to have to play my ipod on maximum power to even begin to drown out talking and noise around me. With these, I can have full isolation with 1/4 power. In fact, these are so great that I've never had to turn my ipod on full power with these in. I think my eardrums would feel like dying if I did... The cord length is generally very nice. I can have my ipod in my pocket and don't have issues with that when walking or anything like I have with the generic ipod earbuds. I'm somewhat tall, too, as is my boyfriend who recommended these. (5'9" and 6'3" or something like that) I guess I just wish they came in different colors, but that's a bit of a nonissue when experiencing great quality.

Any budget-strapped teenager looking for quality should consider this product. Considering the fact that these earbuds used to be premium, $50+ earbuds, the [...] price change is a welcome sight for the eyes. These earbuds are many steps above the earbuds included with any Ipod or music playing product. It is very durable for the uses intended for it. In school, it is great for blocking out the irritating noises made by various freshmen. This earbud's quality may not be the best, but it is the best for this kind of money. Don't go looking for the best, perfect sounding earbuds under $30 bucks. It usually doesn't work that way... It is a very comfortable pair of earbuds. It even includes other sizes you can put on there, to determine whether or not you want it inside your ear canal or snug right outside of it. However, it is prone to being lost in anything that scrapes against it too hard. Like your pocket. I have abused this product and have used it for over a year; there is still no sign of one earbud losing any sound anytme soon. One cord of the earbud should be shorter than the other one. This keeps the earbuds from being torn off of your head by something or being caught on an object if you wear them running behind your head. I would recommend this product for anybody looking for quality at a low price. It can also trick your friends into thinking that you just forked out $60 on a quality product. This makes it great for gifts.

I have been using my Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds for a about a month now and they are perfect for me. Good sound quality and comfortable. The nice part is that they are small. The bad part is they are small. Nice because you hardly notice you are wearing them. Bad because it makes them a little difficult to place in your ear. But once they are securely in place, wow, the sound is very good. I use them on my bus ride in to work everyday and they do a great job of keeping out the sound of the bus and let me enjoy my podcast or music. But you have to make sure they are really in tight and secure to get the full sound spectrum. If they are a little loose the bass tones really drop out. But overall, definitely a great value.

I've been buying the sony earbuds the last several years and on a lark bought a pair of these. They are as good as the sony as far as sound quality goes. I can't tell a difference but my audio books are not always of the highest bit rate. The one thing I did not like was the rubber coating of the wires is soft and "sticky". They are more prone to tangle. The wires on my sony earbuds mdr-ex71 are "slicker" and "stiffer" and less prone to tangle. years ago sony made some that were soft and the rubber coating quickly failed. So I'm cautious about the durability of the sennheiser. Just FYI, not good or bad but the design of the sennheisers is for uneven wire lengths for right and left earbuds. If that is what you like. I later found out they are top rated by consumer reports The price is the best! A great pair of headphones to have around when going to the gym or when the primary set fail or get lost.

Works very well. Nice bass considering that these are earbuds. I use this with my netbook, cellphone, and ipod. Not entirely "noise canceling" but I rather not have it that way. Does block out a lot of sounds around you. Overall, very satisfied with the price and quality of the product.

I have tried numerous types of earphones previous to this one, and none of them had the sound quality, comfort, stylishness, convenience, and almost invisible appearance as these earbuds. Its cost has greatly been reduced since it was given to me as a gift a year ago, so I recently purchased another pair, just in case I needed to have them around for any other listening equipment. I have been using them to listen to Sound Therapy CDs by Dr. Tomatis and Patricia Joudry (purchased from Tools for Wellness), which is an alternative approach to helping people with hearing loss. This method requires many hours of listening to music that is recorded on a wider range than normal. I saw a profound improvement in my hearing once I started using the Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds and found that there is a direct correlation to how fast and well my hearing improves to the quality of sound the ear phones deliver. These earbuds are also small and far less cumbersome than the other listening devices I've used and are so comfortable that I often fall asleep with them still in my ears. They can be easilty stored in my pocket, backpack, or anywhere else where it can remain inconspicuous.

I am no sound or music geek, but I noticed a marked improvement in the sound of my current playlist (through an iPod) with these earphones.

I'm a bit of an audiophile, but I needed cheap earbud speakers for me to abuse. These guys are both cheap, and not bad sounding. If you're sensitive about sound quality, the first thing you'll probably notice is the muffled sound you get out of these buds. They're quite bass-heavy, and it feels like the trebles aren't as well represented. The only other complaint I carry so far is that the cords to the buds are not the same length, as if they expect it to be easier to wrap the wire around the back of your head instead of just have them hanging in front of you. I disagree with their expectation, but oh well. Not a deal-breaker to say the least. The cable is long enough to put my mp3 player in my pocket and listen comfortably without any fear that my eardrums are going to be torn from my delicate body. Honestly, Sennheiser kicks ass. I have a pair of their HD555s and they're the greatest things ever. You're not going to find a better deal than these earbuds. Go with it.

I have own many different brands of earphones, earbuds, etc. The CX300 are the best that I have found in all aspects. They sound good, look good, well made. The wire is silicon as well as the in-ear seals. This is important if you have the skin oil that I do that reacts with other kinds of insulation. After a while I find the wires on my earphones stiff and hard. The screen the use for protecting the driver is durrable too. I got mine at Sears on a closeout and paid more than Amazon quotes, and still one of the best buys ever. I use them for audiobooks, and find if I get into a book that is boring, I can listen to music with all the lows and highs.

Header: Good earphones. Died within a month., November 23, 2009
Comment:
These are both my first "in-ear" earphones and my first experience with Sennheiser. I'm not a convicted audiophile, but I do have a pretty good ear. Here's the overview: Good sound for the price (I paid 18 bucks). Great bass, especially. Medium comfort for me, but your mileage may vary. Died a slow, agonizing death within a month of purchase. And specifics: They "isolate" noise very well. I had to take one bud out of your ear if you want to talk to someone, even with no music playing. I hope that doesn't bother you. They're loud. That is to say, it hurt my ears above 40% on my computer, and I would routinely crank my previous headphones and earphones to 100 for long periods of time. With these, you'll never keep hitting the "increase volume" button out of frustration again, even on a noisy subway. Great bass. Even after boosting the bass frequencies 6-9 decibels, the bass was clear. At higher volumes, it almost rattled. Treble didn't slack off either. These earphones were a large sound improvement over my favorite $40 headphones (some Sony ones--I forget the model). They're not the most comfortable, at least for me. I think I have incredibly average-sized ear canals, but even with the extremely medium-sized rubber tips attached (it comes with small, medium, and Bigfoot-sized), the darn left earbud kept falling out. I'd just sit there and it would slowly work its way out, making rubbing noises as it went. Not fun. Of course, you will most likely have a completely unique experience. After a few days of break-in, I think the bass really mellowed out. But the treble and midrange were still very nice. It was at this time that it felt like I was slowly going deaf in my left ear. The left ear bud just kept getting quieter and quieter. To compensate, I would move the balance to the left. This continued very slowly for a couple weeks. Right now, with the pan set at 96% to the left, it's still biased to the right, and I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to having the sound properly balanced. And even at 100% volume, I can hardly hear any sound. I wish I knew what caused that. It's mildly ridiculous, and the reason for the one star review. These buds have died, and only after less than a month. I spent quite a while looking around for my warranty information with no luck. I think these buds would have been a pretty good value if they, you know, worked, but I won't be buying a replacement pair. Hey, hope this helps.

Comment:
I like these headphone overall, the price point is fantastic but they have their flaws. I'd say you get what you pay for with these. After seeing that these were Amazon's best selling headphones and reading the reviews I was very excited to buy these. However, when I first used them I was left thoroughly unimpressed. Over time, these have gradually grown on me and I am less disappointed. They are undoubtedly solid for sitting and casual listening and the sound quality is great. However my primary use for them is jogging. It took a while to find a good fit in the earbuds, but even now that I have a solid fit I find I have to constantly readjust them while running. Worst of all is the quality of the sound while running. Frankly it is unacceptable. The wind whistles through them and the cable noise is very loud. But I will accept blame for that choice, these are not supposed to be used for athletic activities anyway I assume.

Comment:
UPDATE!!! I changed my rating from 1 to 3 stars because it looks like I was sold a bootleg set of earphones. Thanks to another Amazon member, I was able to compare with photos on another website that showed me what to look for to identify the fake. I have no idea how the real ones sound, and Sennheiser never responded to my inqiry. All I can do at this point is give a neutral 3 stars and warn everyone that you may be sold fakes here on Amazon if you buy from a private seller. Also, it is entirely possible that such sellers do not even know that they are selling fakes. Here is my original review just for reference purposes: I do not understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews on this! Either they all work for Sennheiser, or they have no concept of good sound, or the set I got was completely defective. I had sennheiser lightweight open aire headphones in the 70s that sounded awesome for a price of $25. I expected similar performance from these, but I was terribly disappointed. They sounded no better than the cheap earphones that came with the old iPod shuffle. Also, I had to play with the plug to get sound into both earphones at the same time, but it didn't matter since the sound was unacceptable whether or not I received both channels. Also, the lopsided design of the wire is terrible. I ended up buying sony earphones for $26.00 from BestBuy. They perform as well as I expected from these sennheisers, and are very comfortable for all size ear canals. I contacted Sennheiser, but they failed to respond...the company is useless as far as customer service is concerned. Do not believe the positive reviews! If you know good sound, you will not be happy with these.

Header: Blocked out my loud, obnoxious cube-mates, November 17, 2009
Comment:
I initially bought these because of one, the great reviews, and two, because I really wanted an inexpensive pair of headphones that would block out the people I work with. You would think in a work environment, people would be more well-mannered. This is not so, and I work in an office setting where most of our work does NOT require interaction. That being said, if you're trying to block people out, these work GREAT. Before, I had to turn my headphones up to a point where I honestly thought I'd go deaf. Now? It's at most....1/4 of the way up. Not even. And I like to blast my music. My only gripe was that the little buds didn't fit as amazing as I'd like, but you get 3 different sizes! So that helps, I ended up having to use a larger bud on one ear and the smallest one on the other. (I guess I must have some retarded ear canals?) I'm on the fence about whether or not I'd consider these REALLYREALLY comfortable. I mean, they're not bad and I wear them all day without too much bugging me. The cord itself could be longer...but that's just because I have it hooked into a computer. Overall. Great pair of buds for the price. (~$17)

Header: Cord too short but excellent sound, November 17, 2009
Comment:
The cord is too short for this unit and the extension cord it comes with is a bit cumbersome for people that like to exercise with their iPod. (For those that don't know it comes with a short cord, but also an extension cord that makes the cord longer if you would like that plugs in between the short cord and the ipod/mp3 player) The sound quality is AWESOME though. I would say the sound quality far outweighs the cord issues I have had with it. If you simply get an arm case it will take care of the short cord issues. I like to wear my iPod on my waist when running so I put it in front and it barely has enough cord. I don't like to use the extension as it bounces around too much on my torso when running. This unit does completely seal your ears so you will not be able to hear anything when using the unit, especially while running or exercising outdoors. For women who exercise outdoors, this might be a safety concern. The other complaints people have with the sounds from the cord rubbing are issues with any noise canceling ear bud out there. You simply get used to it, or you shouldn't be buying ANY noise canceling type bud. I don't even hear extra sounds of the unit rubbing or anything anymore, so I wouldn't consider this issue when deciding to buy. For sound, these units are the best dollar for dollar. I had Sony's and Apple buds prior to this and these buds blow them away for sound quality. Overall I am very happy with them.

Comment:
I bought these after being dissatisfied with the Sennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphones. I've had them for four days and used them extensively (at least four hours daily) in that time. Included are three sets of "ear adapters" (small, medium, large) so you're likely to find a fit suitable for you. Note that the use of earbuds can be dangerous, depending on how well you fit the ear adapters, as virtually all external noise is eliminated. I wouldn't recommend a city pedestrian (or anyone else in a situation with the need to be aware of external sound) to wear these! These earbuds handle bass far better than the PX 100s. In fact, all around, they sound much better than the PX 100s: they pass the "Nirvana Nevermind" test (bass and drums sound fine) and the classical music test (various Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach pieces sound good). Also, unlike the PX 100s, I can wear these for hours at a time before I start to feel a very slight soreness in my ear canal. I can also sleep on my side with only a very mild discomfort. The cord is a bit "rubbery" which transmits vibration (from rubbing against your clothing, say), but this effect is minimized if you wear the right (longer) ear cord behind your neck as is recommended. The cord is about 3 feet long (could use about a foot, IMO) and has a 3.5 mm L-shaped plug, which is safer for your MP3 player as much less force is transmitted to the socket should you accidentally "lever" your player with the plug. There is no carry pouch included, product description notwithstanding. Overall, the pluses far outweigh the minuses should earbuds satisfy your requirements.

Header: Great sound quality for the price, cord a little noisy, November 17, 2009
Comment:
The sound these little things put out is pretty impressive. Its not as clear as you what you would get if you spent $100 on some high fidelity buds, but it really doesn't leave much to be desired. The bass response is excellent, mids and highs are pretty good, although I have noticed some distortion on some high-pitched vocals. The mix is good with the ranges expressed faithfully to how the music was recorded. The rubberized cord can make some noise when slapped around or when it rubs against something hard, like a backpack strap. This can be minimized by running the cord under your shirt. The cord may be a bit short sometimes if you have deep pockets, but usually the length is just right. For this price, these buds are hard to beat.

I debated for awhile with myself if I should buy earbuds or not but now am happy I picked these ones. Take them with me to work to use with my mp3 player when I am on breaks and in the mood for some music. Also use them at my pc to listen to music, play games, and watch movies...was surprised how much sound I get and the depth compared to what I let myself be used to before. Only other ones I had are the ones which came with my mp3 player and another cheap pair of Koss earbuds I bought a couple year ago when I had none. Bought earlier this year a headset from some brand I can't think of now, but wanted to use it for watching movies and playing games at the PC, it seemed good the first few weeks but after that bothered me to wear for longer then 20 mins at a time. Happy doing this with my earbuds for now but only complaint is the wire is a little to short for where I sit, can't have everything tho and in the future hope to find a good headset or headphones for at the PC.

The audio quality is slightly above average, but the offset cord is annoying and tangles easily. There are decent ear buds of similar sound quality for slightly less. Look for a right-angle jack as this will last longer in iPods. Also, the smallest ear adapters on this are still larger than other makers. There is no strain relief on the cord going to the ear bud, so it is harder to insert properly.

The major problem with these head phones is the cord length. They are not long enough for my mp3 player to be in my pocket and for the buds to go into my ears. Another problem is that the right and left cord lengths are asymmetrical which is awkward. With that being said, the good things include: great sound quality and durability. These headphones greatly reduce outside noise. I was walking with people and couldn't hear them with only the volume half up.

Comment:
I bought a pair of CX-300's back in 2007 when I started film school, I ordered them not really knowing what to expect, but I wanted something that would isolate noise and provide decent sound quality. By decent I mean not too much treble, but not drowned out by bass, I knew Sennheiser was a good brand, but that was about it. I only paid around $22 shipped for mine. When they first arrived and I tried them out, I was completely blown away. I had never tried an inner-ear headphone before these, my only experience with headphones were your usual Panasonic or Sony pair that run from 30-60 bucks. The type of music I listen to ranges from Hip Hop and Rap to Grindcore and Thrash metal, and I've listened to it all with my CX-300's. It alllll sounds great. In fact, if you listen to metal, I have yet to find another set of headphones that make metal sound that good, the clarity is amazing, I was scrambling to find all my old albums to hear stuff I had never noticed before even on big speakers. I also used the CX-300's for my work on student films when I was a sound mixer, I couldn't afford big expensive noise-isolating headphones, and these worked fantastically. They survived 2 student desert film shoots, and many other shoots, a few times I dropped them in the sand on accident and stepped on them, I also forgot they were attached to me and yanked myself from the sound mixer without damaging them at all, I did that a lot actually, the cord is very tough. Two years later, I handed them down to my sister and they still work great! Part of the reason I wrote this review 2 years after I bought the headphones is because I purchased a set of the supposed upgrade from the CX-300 to the CX-500b's, and after having them for a couple months, I miss my 300's and plan on buying another pair soon. The 500's have way too much bass. I find that most metal songs sound muddy and usually just plain bad, even with an EQ. I even did a thorough online check to see if I had received a fake but I had not. The 500's are still great for two things though: music with A LOT of bass and...video games! I found they work great when playing PC games, but I'm definitely going to order that new pair of 300's and keep them plugged into my mp3 player.

Comment:
Sennheiser delivers quality in these little earbuds. The noise isolation is great for busy offices and coffee shops, the sound quality is crisp and clear. The cord is a bit short, especially considering the asymmetrical design (a little strange at first, but I'm getting used to it). Could be a little cheaper, but you have to pay for quality. Excellent for music lovers, those who want to drown out the outside world and those who want to look hip while doing it!

Wanted earbud style headphones with an 90% angle plug-in. The sound quality is great, comfort is great. Makes air travel so much more pleasant. I wish the cord were 12" longer, but a minor issue. I have used them a lot with no problems, but I do not pull on them by their cord. I think if you did they might not hold up too well. I do like the sound and comfort and would buy them again.

Header: great sound, cord too short, November 5, 2009
Comment:
I really want to like these headphones. I've had them for about six months and I think the sound quality is great for how much they cost. They're really comfortable, too. But the cord length on these things was definitely designed for someone who is wearing this on an armband or something. This is great, if you are one of those people. Unfortunately I'm not. The cord is so short that I can't have my mp3 player at my waist comfortably. That's kind of ridiculous! It does come with an extension cord, but when you have the extension cord on, it's way too long. A bunch of tangled cord in your pocket is not cool.

Header: Much worse than E2C, November 4, 2009
Comment:
I already have an SE530 and an older E2C & Etymotic ER6 with frayed wiring. I bought these mostly to use in the gym. I was very disappointed with these, even though they only cost $20. The sound isolation is almost nonexistent, the sound quality is terrible, they're really uncomfortable and hard to put in my ears. I did't expect them to be as good as the expensive SE530, but they don't even compare to what you can get for $60-$80. These are unusable to me. I can't bear to hear my favorite songs destroyed by the horrible sound. I'm going to get a new SE110/115-K.

Header: Great for the price, but you will be disapointed if you are a audiofile, November 4, 2009
Comment:
I got these after much research on the different in ear buds. I where going to get the sony mx's but i was not a big fan of bass. Initially it does the job but i am not a fan of the cord length. the left side is shorter than the right. which can be a pain in the butt since i wear them to work and my ipod touch tug at the left side making it pop out of my ear. if the Y slip had equal length on both sides i would probably give it a five. I found the smallest size to fit my ears and they are comfortable enough to sleep in. they do feel a bit cheap. especially the cord. Since i have had ear buds with cords that end up slipping on me that would be a big worry for me. But so far their great. I do have to find that alot of my songs on my ipod lack treble so with the treble eq on the ipod activated i find the music super enjoyable. Not big bass very subtle. i would say these earphones are more towards contemporaneous and rock type music. With the lack in bass any type of club or hip hop mix only does an above average job. But i am by far not an audiophile so it is just my opinion. i would probably wear them more casually then using them at work when you move around a lot. Their great for the price but i guess kind of expected bigger pods in the mid sections especially the treble. But it would be just a hardware thing with my ipod touch. i recommend them for people wanting to find cheap fairly priced inear bugs.

Comment:
These little ear buds are a fantastic value at their price. You cannot expect in-ear headphones to get much better than this without going way up in price. I was impressed with their comfort and external noise isolation. On the train going to work they effectively cut out a good portion of the train and people noise, and at my desk at work they do a good job of clearing out the background noise clutter. This means you can listen at a lower volume (good for your ears) and still enjoy your music. You can't really expect little headphones like this to put out as much bass as big over the ear types, but they gracefully drop off on the low end in a way that is pleasing to the ear. I listen to everything from classical to metal to hip hop and they have done well with all of them. I'm not a fan of the "one side is longer than the other" (offset) cord, and I wish the cord were longer, but for most personal music player usage it works great. I also think they should include just a cheap little protective pouch to put them in when you're not using them, but luckily I had something that would work. Recommended overall - great bang for the buck.

When i purchased it, I wasnt expecting it to be fantastic (for 20$ bucks - no way). But I was in for a pleasant surprise. To be clear, i am not a professional requiring the best quality that money can buy, but I do like my music and hate imbalance in bass and/or treble. The Sennheiser CX300 goes very well with my iPhone and provides clear music. It worked pretty well in canceling some noise as well. I travel a lot and have put the phones through some rough use and it has held well. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and might consider replacing my Sony headphones (when they are due for change) with a better version of Sennheiser. I recommend a buy.

Header: Phenomenal sound for the $15-$30 earbud range, October 29, 2009
Comment:
Are these headphones guaranteed to blow your pair of high-end Shure headphones? Well, no, but considering that these headphones originally retailed for $50 and defining them with that perspective in mind, this pair is definitely head-and-shoulders above the rest. At the time of this review, I purchased these headphones for approximately $20 and they are by far the best pair of earbuds that I have ever purchased within this price range. Other headphones/earbuds that I've tried lately in the $15-$25 range suffer from the same problem of trying to impress with bass and letting every sound in the mid- to high-range frequencies sound "muddy." These headphones, while not overpowering in the bass department, do deliver a respectful and "honest" bass response (read: not overpowering to the point of questioning if that's what the original sound was really like) and remain true to the higher frequencies ranges as well without sounding "bright" or "tinny." For the price, you can't beat this pair; for the $15-$25 price range, Sony, Panasonic, and JVC are nowhere close to this league.

Header: A Sharp Contrast to iPod Earbuds!, October 29, 2009
Comment:
I bought these as a replacement to the generic Apple Earbuds, which, by the way, are awful and should be immediately replaced by these if you are using them currently. As an affordable replacement to the Apple Earbuds, they are top notch. The physical noise cancelling works wonderfully due to a nigh hermetic seal between your ears and the outside world. Sound is a contrast as well, although I feel like the Apple Earbuds would sound great if you had the audacity to press them into your ears whenever you were to wear them. Am I impressed with the sound? No, I'm not, but this is probably because I do my sedentary listening with a pair of Grado SR60's, which absolutely blow these Sennheisers out of the water in all fields of sound. This, however, is besides the point. I find the sound of the Sennheisers to be a bit muddy, and simply not as precise as other high end headphones. Then again, these aren't high end headphones. They cost twenty dollars, and for twenty dollars, I am very satisfied. Pros: In ear design provides awesome physical noise cancelling. You can barely hear people talking right next to you. Good sound, but not amazing or good enough to make me wonder why I bought my Grados. (Yes, I did burn them in) HUGE step up from Apple Earbuds. Cons: Not the best sound, but pretty damn good for twenty dollars. Perhaps construction? I see no need to worry though, as it seems fairly solid. This is my second day owning them though. Bottom Line: Highly recommended if you are looking for an affordable step up from Apple Earbuds (which are awful, to hammer that point in). Wonderful physical noise cancelling, making them ideal for train or plane commute. I would have given them 3.8 stars if possible. Yes, you should buy them.

I had horrible durability problems with Vmoda earphones so I tried these as the price is right. I'm actually surprised as these phones sound better than I expected them to for the price. They won't have the bass or the "crack" that more expensive phones have but they do the job. My biggest issue is that the earphones never give me a snug fit in my ears. I never had problems with the Vmoda. I think these are just too short for my ear canals. I've tried multiple tips to no avail. The asymmetrical chord takes getting used to but hasn't posed much of a problem. I figure these will eventually become my backup pair and I'll move to something that has a better fit. Not a bad buy for the money.

Fair price for the the ear buds. Sound is ok. Imaging and frequency response are satisfactory.

Header: Good sound, but comfort/cord length bothers me, October 26, 2009
Comment:
I bought these after I lost my Sony MDR in-ear headphones while walking through the crowded streets of Times Square. I can't remember well enough to compare this Sennheiser sound quality to what I previously had with Sony's, but it certainly is good enough for casual listening and does a good job of blocking out sound during my commute. I'm a little disappointed by its comfort though. None of the bud sizes seem to fit my ear as well as the ones I had from Sony. I always find them sliding/popping/dropping out from time to time. And compounding the problem is the cord length that is shorter than what my old Sonys were. I find the cord is just taut enough that sometimes while walking my jacket or something can slightly tug on the cord and pull it out of my ear. Frustrating indeed...

I've been going through several pairs of open, on-ear full-size headphones but I needed to get earbuds that blocked noise and didn't leak like crazy (like my open ones do) Anyways, I was a bit skeptical when I ordered these (after reading comparisons on head-fi forums) but I have been nothing short of impressed. Here's one tip- if you get in-ear earbud make sure they come with different size earpieces. These headphones do. This is extremely important!!! if they don't, plan to buy some separately. Everyone's ears are different in size so make sure the earpieces fit right. Sound = 4/5 Bass = 4/5 Noise Cancelling = superb For this price point (mine were sixteen) you can't find something that is this sturdy and with this sound quality. They are awesome! EARBUDS MAY INDUCE MASSIVE WAX ATTACKS: Also, if you not used to wearing in-ear earbuds - be aware - because the earbud is a "foreign object," your ear canals might (like mine do) produce ear wax to combat it. Yuk! I clean my ears before and after i use these guys. Bottom line: Get these headphones- they are affordable sturdy sound great ample bass isolate well come with different sized earpieces well designed - left is shorter than the right, which wraps around behind your head ALSO- you can lie down with them in your ears because they don't stick out like others do

I bought a set of these along with a pair of the J-Buds J2 earbuds since both were deeply discounted on Amazon. I thought I'd compare the two to see which one I liked better since I was so sick of using my uncomfortable iPhone earbuds. Hands down, the Sennheisers are the superior product. I love how the electric blue J-Buds look, but that's their only plus. The Sennheisers' sound is crisp and full. Good bass response without being overwhelming. Panning sounds accurate and no breakup with increased volume. I was skeptical about the assymetrical cords but once I put the buds in I was pleasantly surprised. This design works fine for me. I also like the angled plug, something that the J-Buds didn't have. As someone else mentioned before me, the earbuds themselves are small in size and low in profile. The fit snugly in my ears and aren't easily knocked out. I can even lay on my side with these in my ears and not feel like anything is protruding very much. I was able to get through the packaging with a serrated pair of heavy duty scissors. Just be careful - you don't want to cut the earbud cords! I'm satisfied with this product, and for the price they're a steal.

Great headphones, put impossible to get out of the box. Knives do not penetrate this shell material; they should be making bullet-proof vests out of it. Pro tip: If you have a cat, use the cat's nail clippers to open the box, it's the only way to do it without hurting yourself. Sound quality is excellent, and the three different size ear fittings (included) make the phones very comfortable regardless of ear size. Another pro-tip: if you're clumsy like me and rip these headphones wires - use a flame to quickly singe the fiber strands inside the cables before trying to solder the wires together. Also, heating the wires first as you apply solder helps remove the insulating coating they use on individual strands.

My favorite part was the design.

It might sound confusing, but it will make more sense when you get it.

Boomy and muddled bass really ruin what could be a decent "budget" pair of headphones. Subpar bass is common for cheap earbuds, but a lack of bass response is far preferable to the muddled mess that comes with these. The asymmetrical cord design is a bit of an annoying gimmick as well, though not a deal breaker. Overall, I'd rather have a set of stock Zune earbuds than these... I've been pleased by Senn products in the past but really can't recommend these as an upgrade from anything.

These are very good headphones for the price, however the build quality leaves a little to be desired. If I had to do it again, I would probably purchase 2 pairs and keep one as backup- especially at this amazon price. After only a week of heavy usage, the right earbud began 'buzzing' at certain frequencies. It is repeatable with different songs and audio sources. Nevertheless, I am still impressed with the audio quality (the crispness of the mids and highs are fantastic.) The bass is a little muddy and lacking in punchiness, but deep and rich. Despite the buzzing phenomenon, I am still using these headphones until my replacements come (JLabs J2 Premium)

Header: Works with GPS, October 19, 2009
Comment:
I bought these to primarily use with my GPS while riding my motorcycle -- I wanted to hear turn alerts/instructions. They needed to be modestly priced, clear sounding, noise attenuating, efficient (loud with low power input) and, critically, they needed to be small enough to fit in my ears and still fit comfortably under my motorcycle helmet. At this discount/sale price these are great: the large size silicone gasket (these come with three sizes of gaskets) seals outside sound adequately to allow hearing the GPS without the volume being too loud. My GPS is a Magellan 2500 (Crossover) and these Sennheisers match up very well. They have excellent clear sound with good balance between bass and treble, making the voice of the GPS understandable, despite the "road noise". If these survive taking the helmet on and off many times, they will be a great success -- I haven't had them long enough to determine how they'll last. Another good aspect of these is the wire/cord doesn't seem to create noise in the earphones as much as others -- very little cord noise. The music performance of these is also very good to my ears (a good balanced sound, with reasonably accurate hi-fi) -- these do not have an over-emphasis on bass, and that is good for me. I tried several other modestly priced earbuds before these and none of them had a clear enough sound to do the job -- these do, and at this sale price nothing else I've found comes even close -- if I knew they were going to last, I'd give them 5 stars.

Comment:
Purchased my first pair of these a couple weeks ago, was quite impressed with the general sound quality and decent abilities of the passive noise-canceling feature of these buds. I then hit a stray corner in the wrong way with the wires hanging slightly from my pocket and boom, they ripped right out of the main headphone jack. That was the First strike. Order the exact same pair a SECOND time, since I was so happy with the quality on the first pair; it arrived with a defective headphone jack. Second and final strike. These headphones may sound nice, and be of a great price, but production quality just isn't there. Cheaply made, Cheaply durable, Cheap performance. Avoid if you can afford a slightly more expensive pair of ear-buds folks; these things have not been kind to me as a whole, and I'm quite disappointed with them, and Sennheiser as a whole for the workmanship that has gone into these. I gave two stars merely because they ARE decent sounding, regardless of their inferior production process.

Header: 300X Sennheiser buds, October 17, 2009
Comment:
First off, I love music. No one is paying me to respond to these buds,I believe in the truth. The first thing you need to decide before buying these is what type of music you like listening to. If you like heavy metal with deep sounding bass and ok high guitar rifts These baby's are for you. If you like the highs with tight far away bass your probably looking for Sony Ear buds. I had Sony ear buds they were clear and great with the highs but the bass just never got there for me. The other thing was the cord they lasted maybe a month but that's not Sonys fault I beat things up pretty much. The other pair of buds I got are the Altec Lansing UHP336 upgrader series headphones I bought here at Amazon.com. The directions on Altec Lansing phones is very obscure so I really don't know which ear is left or right but the sound of the Altec Lansing is top notch. I bought them here for like 30 something bucks. This knowledge in hand, here is the result for $14.00 Sennheiser 300x ear buds on this Amazon site. The 300x are better than the Apple phones,and the best Ear bud phones I ever heard for the price. The comfort and ease of use is extraordinary. The bass on these phones are incredible the treble ok. The short end of the cord goes in the left ear and the right the other. The cord built seems a little old fashion which is good that means it's built much better than the Sony cord. If you want something that will last almost forever with a durable cord and a sound out of this world with a little reading and work buy the Altec Lansing UHP336. You want high crisp sound, ok bass, and a weak cord buy the Sony. NO MATTER which one you choose buy 2 300X's before they change the name and charge you 40$ for them. Sennheiser makes a top of the line product. These are great. One other thing if you have a laptop stop listening to the speakers installed. Plug in some ear buds and welcome yourself to a new world.

Header: You can do better than these, October 16, 2009
Comment:
OK, these are relatively comfy (far more so than my higher end Sennheisers). They don't block much as much sound as the spec indicates (stated attenuation is comparable to my foam earplugs, but they are nowhere near as effective at blocking outside noise). They do tone down outside high frequencies a bit, just enough to take the edge off, but not enough to impede normal conversation or even listening to my stereo. The short cable introduces a ton of noise; every time it touches my shirt or the edge of my table it makes a noise in the ear louder than whatever program I'm listening to via the headphones. Sound is otherwise just OK (I am a bit of an audiophile, but I really wasn't expecting all that much). They are dirt cheap ($10-$20), and easy to wear, but otherwise...meh. Unless you really can't afford more than $15 (in which case you probably have better uses for $ than headphones, like food and rent!) I'd recommend getting something better. These just aren't worth using, and are destined to end up in my spare equipment drawer.

Comment:
While I was fine using the stock iPhone 3G earbuds for the last few months, recently I decided that the Apple buds were not worth the answer/pause/play/skip dongle on the headset. I was on a budget, and while I realize that there are other earbuds with that same button, I wasn't ready to pay the premium for it (especially because I only use that feature when running/working out...times during which isolating earbuds are bad ideas). Anyways, I'd previously purchased Sennheiser over-the-ear headphones (three years ago) and fell in love with their sound. They've worked great, but are too bulky for my daily use. I also had Shure Ec3's but they broke after about a year of regular use. I bought these earphones based on good reviews and with the understanding that they would not surpass my Shure's quality of sound. I listen to an eclectic collection of music, but mostly fall into the folk / subpop category with some pop / hiphop. 4 Weeks Later: Pros: +Excellent Bass [I was afraid that these earbuds would be tuned for too much bass when I read the reviews, but I quickly discovered quality, distortion free, and 'thumpy' bass that only rarely overwhelms other tones (noticed in alternative / orchestral music)] +Comfortable Fit [As comfortable as my old Ec3's, though the plastic seems more flimsy] +Price [It's under $20...I'm on a budget and that didn't even phase me] +Design [Completely a matter of taste, but I find these earbuds to be restrained and classy] +Warranty [Three years assurance] Neutrals: ~Weak Midtones [weak not horrible-you will hear subtleties, but you will not discover new ones] ~Breakin [You MUST break these earbuds in...at first they crackled and had weak sound. after a good 1-2 days of use they were much stronger. at first I was very disappointed] ~Durability [Nothing has gone wrong, but it is something I find myself thinking about due to the light plastic quality that makes up the earbuds] Cons: -Crackle [Occasionally, the earbuds seem to outreach their own ability-creating the occasional crackle. At first this happened all the time during breakin, but now it happens only occasionally. Dissapointing for sennheiser, but I still choose to use these earbuds daily and I feel that that says something] -Sharp Highs [Sometimes the high notes are too bright; again, this has only happened on occasion] Overall, I am happy with an asterisk. At first I was very disappointed with the sound quality, but after four weeks of using these earbuds, they are my new favorites. While they lack the detail of my Shure Ec3s, they entirely beat the Shures with quality bass. A trade off for sure, but for $80 less it should be a no brainer.

Comment:
Certainly not a bad deal for the price I paid ($15.99). They are definitely not a bass driven sound like Sennheiser claims. They have a fairly bright sound. I get much better bass from my V-Moda Vibe ear buds. I gave the CX300's at least a 15 hr break-in before comparing them to my Vibe's. They're a good backup set but they will not be my primary headphones. The asymmetrical cord length is not my favorite but it works and I didn't seem to be getting feedback through the cord.

Read the glowing reviews for these when I lost my Zune stock earbuds, and decided to go for it. A cheap mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. I use my Zune while working out at the gym, and as soon as I started up my playlist with these connected, I noticed cracking noises and severe acoustic inaccuracies. As far as the noise canceling issue goes, I heard a conversation going on about six feet away while using these. Don't make my mistake; get something else.

Comment:
This works great for blocking out road/engine/crowd noise in the 1 hour bus trips that I take daily back and forth to college. Good enough that I can't hear anyone speaking next to me and that no one can hear my music banging and annoying them. Saves battery because you don't need to turn up the volume on your mp3 player. One thing that I hate about it though is the asymmetrical cord which, to me, is not comfortable and yes I do wear it do correct way. I guess I'm just not used to it even after 2 months. I'm no audiophile, but I would recommend these to anyone looking for a decent pair of buds under $20. It goes great with my Sansa Clip 4GB and I'm happy!

Comment:
I owned a pair of V-moda bass freq which broke after two years of ownership. I decided to by these cx300s because they were $16 and a bit cheaper. Overall, the cx300 have good sound quality but isn't excellent. the highs are very good, the mids are excellent, the bass is fair (but much stronger than the regular ipod ear buds). when you put it all together, you get a rather neutral sound. it sounds like a really good pair of headphones, Not like you actually there in the sound booth listening to the artist singing. These are way better than the competition, but aren't as good as v-moda. the v-moda's have a warm rich sound, while these are bit colder. However, these are more comfortable because the V-moda's are way too bass heavy and that can hurt your ears. If you aren't an audiophile and want Good balanced sound, buy these. CX300 are good overall.

Comment:
I asked for these for Christmas last year after a friend recommended them. I have been in love with them ever since. I ended up purchasing a second pair to leave at work since the price had come down quite a bit. And now its half of what I paid for in a couple months ago (already half of original price), normally that would make me upset... but I think I am going to buy a third pair, you really can't beat this price. Pros: 1. The earbuds almost completely seal out external noise, and they're very comfortable (comes with three different sizes of buds) 2. These are J-cord earbuds (the right bud's cord is longer and wraps around the neck), which I like a lot and is perfect for exercising or bike riding -- could be a con for some I guess. 3. The sound quality is great, the bass reproduction is excellent (I'm no audiophile), but I love the sound. 4. They're very light and comfortable. If you fall asleep in them (I often do), you're not going to wake up with a sore ear. Thoughts: 1. The cord feels a little fragile, I haven't damaged them yet, but I haven't been too strenuous on them either. 2. The cord length is just long enough to reach into my pockets (I'm 5'9"), if you're taller you might want to think about it.

For a set of headphones for listening at home I would never choose these. They're simply too "low end", but.... for on the go listening, a set of ear buds to throw into the gym bag or give to your kids, these are perfect. I bought these for my kids and even though they've gone through a couple of pairs, each has lasted through several months of abuse in backpacks and gym bags, pockets, and cars. I recommend these for a discerning listener who doesn't want to take their high end ear buds out of the house. The sound quality is better than other cheap sets of ear buds I've tried as well.

I seldom write a review, but with nearly 1000 folks saying mostly positive things about these buds, I figured it was worth a few minutes to share my dislike. It is simple.

I love the balance and respectable bass of my 13.5mm driven sony MDR-EX85LP/Red Ex Monitor Stereo Headphones though it amazes me that Sony makes them, I never much liked Sony.

These are my feelings about CX300 after downgrading from CX400. I use the headphones all around (commuting, recreation and white noise during work). On the CX400, cord tore from wear - maybe too fancy headphones for running ... CX300 seem more durable. + cord length + cord quality + price + L-shaped plug - quality of plug and contacts between cord and plastic - sound quality when compared to CX400!! Overall, CX300 are well worth the price if you use them for during recreation. For commuting and indoor use, I'd go for the CX400 sound quality.

Header: Good Sound; Frustrating Packaging, October 6, 2009
Comment:
I've been looking for a "cheap" but tolerable set of earbuds to use with an iPod nano when I'm working in the yard or doing something active. I've got Etymotic ER-4s which are great for listening when you're not putting them at risk, but I wouldn't want to damage them while pruning trees! I've tried a number of inexpensive sets of earbuds (mostly Sony) in the $20-40 range and haven't been crazy about the sound. Canal earbuds in this range tend to have way too much bass. These Sennheisers, normally a bit higher in price than I was looking at but selling for $17 at Amazon when I bought them are still a little bassy, but a huge step up over the others that I've listened too. My only other complaint is that the cable seems a little short for active use and at least 5" shorter than most Sonys. So, I would say they're an excellent value, especially at the low price that they're selling at now. The sound greatly surpasses what you'd normally expect for $20 earbuds. The one thing I really didn't like was the packaging - they come in a very, very tough plastic clamshell. The way it's welded shut, you can't attack it with scissors. You really need to have a sharp knife. And since you can't see where the cable is stowed in the inner packaging, you're reluctant to stab at the shell too hard. It turns out that the (short) cable is all folded up in the upper bubble of the shell, so you can hack away with impugnity without too much risk, but of course, you only know that after you've gotten them out! If you saw the second episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm this year watching Larry try to get a GPS unit out of it's packaging, you'll feel deja vu...

These have great sound but not better than the skull candy in my opinion. The thing that concerns me is the durability. The wires are very thin and delicate. I don't think this is for someone who likes to roll up the buds and put them in your pocket. The other thing I don't like is the shortness of the cord and the fact the cables to the earbuds are not the same length. Why to they do this. all the weight of the cable hands off one earpiece which eventually works it out of your ear if you are active. I would only buy these if I got a great price because I don't think they will last too delicately built.

Comment:
The headphones sound great, a little heavy on the bass, but that can be fixed with the EQ IF you dont like it. The smaller ear pad (of 3) fit my ear just fine and it hasnt fallen off once. Sound isolation here is, of course, due to the nature of ear buds and not because of any special mechanism, and its pretty good for most situations. The 3.5 mm jack is curved instead of stick straight out so if you wrap your headphones around your MP3 like I do, then the cord should be ok and not rip, like some Skullcandys did on me, thank goodness. Overall, I believe these are definitely some, if not, the best buds for the price. I'll be buying more Sennheiser in the future for sure.

the sound is fine, though a bit higher than the original Sansa headphones I have for my player. They fit nicely and comfortably inside the ear canal. The only, but potentially serious, problem with this product is that its cord is sensitive to every little tap, even of the hoop earrings dangling against the cord. It makes you feel like you are a diver under water surface and feel noises coming from outside world. So if you sit and listen to your music - everything is fine, but if you walk or jog - it could be very unpleasant.

These earbuds are horrible. While the sound quality is good if you are absolutely still, if you move at all the cord rubbing against your clothes creates an incredible amount of noise in the earbuds; almost to the point of downing out even loud metal and punk music. I been through two sets of headphones, sony and koss, and two sets of earbuds, over the years and I've never heard anything even remotely this bad. I'm baffled as to how they can have such a high rating.

Comment:
The CX300 earbuds have some of the best sound quality in an inexpensive package I've ever heard. Sound quality is incredible given the price. I can guarantee you won't find a better deal anywhere online. I would also invest in some replacement sleeves for the buds since they are quite soft to be comfortable but they are going to rip eventually with regular use. You can find them on here for a few bucks. My only complaint is the cord is about 5-6 inches too short. I'm 6'2" and not a small guy by any measure and my Ipod barely makes it to the bottom of my back pocket. I know they sell an extension but that probably would just be a little cumbersome. As long as you don't mind carrying your Ipod or your shorter than 6 foot you should be alright. Other wise I would maybe go for the CX400 which come with an extension.

I rate these three stars on just about everything except value. They get 5 stars for value. A small amount of money gets you a giant leap above the dreck supplied by most MP3 player sellers. Unless you record at higher rates, you won't notice much difference if you spend more than these cost, anyway, so they are just right for a lot of people. If you record at 256k, consider spending a little more and buying NuForce. Watch our for counterfeit Sennheisers. These are so popular that there are poor counterfeits all over.

It makes me wonder why this could not be done earlier in the past umpteen years. I have to laugh at the earphones that come with the iPod as standard issue ever since day one. The quality of these Sennheisers is entirely satisfactory. I cannot speak for Durability yet, but the wires seem thick enough to last. The price is a bargain for what you get.

If you own an MP3 player and are still using the stock headphones, do yourself a huge favor and buy a pair of these. The stock iPod headphones made my ears hurt after 10 minutes of wearing them and I could never get a good fit. These fit perfectly and I could wear them all day if I wanted to. I'll probably eventually upgrade to some Shures or Etymotics, but for now these work perfectly since I'm on a budget.

I've purchased about 5 different pair of headphones. These so far are the best of the ones I have purchased. Very comfortable, sound quality is great. Very good for using while on NYC subways to block out all the noise that tends to go on and just listen to your music. I liked them so much that when I saw them on sale for under $15, I bought a back-up pair for me and 2 more for friends. Can't go wrong for the price.

I bought these on a recommendation from a CNET reviewer to replace a pair of Lenntek Sonix. They sound mediocre at best. The bass is weak, the high end is irritating and when I'm walking they whistle in the wind. I am returning them and buying another pair of Sonix. Hope this helps

Got the CX300s about a month ago. They are very good for the price they charge. Pros: Solid structure though tinny Bass is solid for their size and price 3 silicon earbuds should fit well Great overall sound when silicons are sealed Good cord length Cons: No other accessories Overall: A good pair of headphones for anyone who wants to enjoy good music without investing in anything like a $200 pair of headsets. For the keen/practical music listener.

These were my first pair of in-the-ear phones. The earphones that came with my iPod would not stay in more than 10 seconds. The rest of the headphones I've tried would not get loud enough to block out the chatty girls next to me on the elliptical. With these, you could select the size of cover that fits your ear the best. I put them in and WOW! No problems hearing my TV show while I was working out. Some have mentioned that you get some noise from the wire touching you, but it's not that bad. Half the time I never even noticed. I would highly recommend these - good sound and drowns out the outside noise. Have already recommended to a friend!

These earphones are really good, the sound is clean and you can hear the bass clearly. It is a little too bassy but not to the extent to bother you or create an unreal listening experience. I only used them for a couple weeks so I can't tell anything about endurance. So far I'm happy with my purchase, for the price they are an excellent option.

Can't quite compare to the higher end shure's and whatnot, but for the money, one of the nicest pair of buds I've ever owned. My only real complaint is that I wish they could be a hair longer....as a tall guy (6'3") I often find this problem...where the cord is just _barely_ long enough to make it from an mp3 player in my pocket to my ears without any resistance. I usually have to cram my ipod in the 5th pocket in my jeans to avoid them popping out on a sharp turn of my head. Overall a nice pair for the money though....good bass response, and decent treble.

I bought these headphones in April of 2008 and have never been happier with a set of headphones. Growing up i used an awesome Pioneer closed ear model but these are so much better. The lows pump out without distortion and the highs are as clear as ever. I've never been impressed by something for this long and for this cheap! I do wish the cord was longer as i keep finding myself tugging a bit so i docked it one star for that. I use these almost every day at work to drown out the noise of coworkers and could not ask for more, they do just that!

Comment:
I had a much more expensive pair of ear buds which after three years loss sound in one earbud. While shopping for a new pair I saw the Sennheiser brand which I was very satisfied with on an my over the ear pair. So I went with these and found the sound very crisp and full range, but the base was not as deep as the other more expensive pair, but satisfactory as most of my listening is classical. The wires between the buds and the buds themselves are very light, which had the benefit of not causing the buds to fall out of the ear. The heavier buds and thicker less flexible wire on my previous pair added weight and were always falling out of my ear. The thinner wires have a tendency to tangle and takes a little more effort to untangle before using. I only use the earbuds for the gym or flying so as to block out the adjacent sounds, as I prefer over the ear type in quieter sourroundings.

Comment:
Recently, I dropped $200 or so on a pair of used Bose Quietcomfort headphones. They do a great job with noice cancellation, and the sound quality is (need I say more...) Bose. However, they're too big, fragile, and expensive for me to take them anywhere besides my computer and perhaps on an airplane ride. After finding out that Bose's version of earbuds run another c-note, I figured I'd try a different variation for a change. My first impression of these is that they do nearly as good of a job of cancelling (well, isolating) noise as my Bose cans, except for the fact that more low-frequency noise comes through (and they actually do a better job cancelling frequencies in the vocal range!). However, the sound quality wasn't nearly as good. Obviously this is an unfair comparison, but the tinny quality of the music, the lack of detail, and the lack of (totally head-crushing) bass make these a viable option for me only when I can't use the Bose (at the gym, on the road, etc.) All in all, for $15 or so, these are clearly an upgrade from stock iPod earbuds, but aren't anywhere near the epitome of quality. Obviously.

The quality of acoustic songs was excellent! These earbuds were a steal at $20 and I look forward to using them more!

Header: Good, but not worth it, September 8, 2009
Comment:
Based on other reviews it was pretty much clear to me that they were very effective in the mid-range frequency. And the reviews didn't lie, mid-range acoustics are nice. Its the two extremes that disappoint: at the lower end you get an uncomfortable static-like noise that can be irritating after sometime. At high-range, the sound is slightly distorted and not as clear. Bass is non-existent. Summary: Good for most everyday users, but for ~$20 there are better choices. Some of the cheaper ones are half the price while offering negligible loss of quality.

I've tried several brands and these are the best for the money. Very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that they are designed with a short cable length on one side which I find annoying. I can't imagine why they designed them like that. Other than that, I am very pleased with them and would recommend them.

Comment:
I had a older pair of sony EX51 from Best Buy cost $50 in 2006, it had good bass, but never impressed me in sound quality, although it had great bass and natural mids but lacked distinct high frequency in music, I always thought was MP3 quality of music I downloaded. Not anymore with this pair of Sennheisers. I put this pair on, first impressed me is the fit, the bad reviews about fit worried me, but this pair fits my ear perfectly. Then I noticed immediately the high frequency in music I never heard before. May be they were in it but just sounded too flat to even notice. The clarity of music is distinct, you can tell the different beats going on at once, where sony's are mushed together. CX-300 sound more dynamic because bass is good, never over powering, yet clear and strong, highs are clear, never tinny or sounded sharp. To me this make me feel there's a EQ turning up the highs but is better because it's natural. The cord is also perfect length, I can have ipod on left or right pants pocket without a lot excess wire like sonys. I never felt the cord dragging down the buds. The wire is thin but I'm confident it was all part of engineering to be light and I'm sure they'll be strong enough for years to come. When I was wearing sony headphones for a while, even if music is not loud, when I take it off, I can't hear very well for couple minutes, I didn't have this problem with CX-300, I was amazed because CX-300 have just as much bass. For $15 this is a steal, I would recommend this headphone 10 times over and Sennheiser won my future business. The only thing I do wish is that Sennheiser would gold plate the connector, sony does it, and gold plated connector do last a bit longer than chrome, I guess it's too much to ask for only $15 shipped.

They come wit one bud longer than the other but not a deal breaker at least not for me. I hope this review was helpful. Def a good deal in my opinion.

When I first received the headphones, they looked great out of the box. I first had problems with them staying in my ear but a quick bud-size change and they stayed perfectly. The short length on the left side is not a problem at all, you just need a little time to get used to it. Also, note that this are noise-canceling earphones, so if someone is talking to you, you will not notice. I mostly use them for the bus ride or during the car, and they have been great. They let me experience my varied music to the max. I'm a musician, so I need to hear the detail in my music, and this does the job. Overall they are perfect and great sound quality, awesome bass! I definitely would recommend this.

Comment:
If you're sitting still, these are an (almost) excellent product. The sound is crisp, clear, and it does block out background noise quite well. (I have difficulty hearing a person talking to me when music is playing--a definite plus if you don't want to be distracted.) However, if like me you find yourself walking, jogging, or using these in an otherwise mobile situation the left side tends to slip out of the ear. (I found this even when using the largest size the earbuds are shipped with.) All in all, at around $15 the price is right if you're sitting at a desk or on a couch reading a book. I wouldn't recommend these as a "versatile" set of headphones by any means though. How I broke it down: Pros: - Clean, clear sound - Noise blocking functionality - Comfortable to wear for long periods (if remaining still) Cons: - Uneven cord length - Poor fit (subjective) Happy listening!

The sound quality of these earbuds are great for the price. Decent bass response. The soft ear pieces are very comfortable for wearing an extended length of time. I routinely wear these for up to 6-7 hours a day at work with no discomfort. The cord could be another 6 inches to a foot longer for my preference. If you're using these with a small arm band mp3 player or similar, you'll be happy. If you use your mp3 at waist level or a belt, you might want to pick up a cord extender or just get a model with a longer cord. My height is 5'10" (for reference).

I bought these as a gift for a friend. He kept buying the cheap, four or six-dollar ones at nearby discount stores, and they'd work for a short time, then quit, or the earpiece hurt his ears. He also had ear infections as a kid, and one ear passage is a little smaller than the other. These, with their different-sized buds, are perfect! He uses the small one in one ear, the larger one in the other. I know it sounds funny, lol, but it matters! He LOVES them. Says the bass sounds great, and they cut surrounding noise enough that he can really enjoy his music, even working around home remodelers! Also, since he'd been using the cheap ones, he didn't realize that good earbuds have cords that are different lengths from the main wire to the buds. One goes from the main wire to one ear, and the other earbud has just enough cord to go under your chin and to your other ear. Can't say how long they'll last, since we just got 'em, but I'm very pleased.

I've had these for about a month, now, and my wife has had her's for three weeks. Give you a hint as to how much I like my Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds? First, these are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever experienced. My wife says the same. Then, the sound quality, and yes, the bass, is so far and above the ones that came with my Sony MP3 player, it was a shock - pure and simple. Everytime I put them on, the sound quality surprises me as to how good it is! Combine the above with the very effective ambient noise attenuation, and I have a terrific sound system. I do hear the "thumping" everytime I touch the cord, but there are two ways around it: Run the cord under my shirt, when I can. I do that in the gym because I don't tuck my shirt in. Or, as someone suggested here, wrap the cord around each ear before inserting, and that stops it very effectively, as well. I've gotten to where I don't wrap it around my ears, anymore. Guess I've gotten used to it. An excellent product and made me glad my Sony originals broke!

Comment:
Dang, these got even cheaper since I bought it :( Anyway, I am very happy with these, especially for the price. The sound isolation is very good for the subway, for listening to music without having to blast it till you go deaf. The asymmetric design I found weird at first, but overall, a Good Thing. I found the bass and overall sound quality very high, especially compared to the default iPod earbuds. Just make sure you get a good seal when you put these buds in your ears, or it will not sound good. There's an interesting 'feature': initially you can hear your footsteps as you walk, as extra thumping bass. Which I thought was pretty cool for some songs as I walked to the beat :) But after a while, I've gotten used to it, and it doesn't bother me. This article [...]) properly describes the 'microphonics' and 'occlusion' that you'll end up hearing. Others have mentioned hearing the microphone cord rubbing on their clothes, but I never heard this, at least as not as much as the footsteps and breathing. Overall, I really like these earbuds, for their sound quality, sound isolation, and price. The microphonics/occlusion is the only drawback I've found, but for the price, I don't mind it at all.

Comment:
These headphones were really inexpensive, but nothing too terrific. A problem with the design of the in the ear headphones is the vibrations picked up through the cord translate really loudly into the headphones. This makes it really annoying when using these while running, walking, etc. It comes with three different sizes of in the ear pieces. This is kind of nice, but I lost one of the sizes that fit my ear really well, so I have to use a size bigger and its pretty uncomfortable. Definitely worth the money though.

As stated in other reviews, you need to make sure that these are in your ear with a seal. I experimented with the different size pads before figuring out that the largest ones create the best seal for me. Once that is done, you can really hear the bass, but in a balanced way - not overbearing at all. This was an inexpensive upgrade from the ipod buds. Blocks out outside noise very well. I'm not sure how you can give these a bad review unless they are improperly fitted in ear, or you like bass that drowns out the rest of the music.

I've gone through a pair of Radius, Sony, Ear Candy, and Sony (again) headphones all because they deliver mediocre sound (at best) and cheap durability.

I'm glad I didn't resist because these are the best headphones I've ever had. The sound quality is supreme, clear, powerful, and it filters out exterior noises pretty well too. The durability must be good because they haven't snapped during my constant exercising within weeks, unlike the other ones I've had. If I lose this pair, I'm sure I'll get them again.

Bought the earbuds because of the many reviews on amazon. Got it today, shipping is pretty fast. The first time I put it into my ears, it sounds fine. Vocal is clear, bass is okay, but a little bit too weak. It worths a three star, but due to the cheap price, I give it a 4 star for worthiness.

I've recently purchased this earphone and I love it ... can't stop using it ( listen to music more than I usually do). The Bass is deep and warm ... I don't really know if that makes sense..lol.. moreover, it blocks outside noise so I can really enjoy my favorite song even if I'm at a very noisy place such as train station or in the market. So far the best in-ear headphone I've ever had. I really suggest this product to anyone out there who is looking for a great earphone with a Very Decent Price !

Comment:
Sound reproduction is high quality, but I've not been able to get a satisfactory "in-ear" fit from these earbuds. The different size pads do not help. As a result, higher volume is required, and some MP3 players cannot drive the earbuds at sufficient volume. I think the fit problem is simply that these earbuds are too short to seat properly in typical human ears.

These headphones are a very good value. They block noise very well, and the three earbud sizes should fit pretty much anyone. The sound is noticeably better than my fifteen-dollar set I had been using and I have found that I am able to pick out lyrics or melodies in some songs that I hadn't noticed before. The behind the head cord might annoy some but I was use to it and I find that it helps the headphones from being torn from your ear or caught on things. The headphones themselves are very small and sleek looking. The packaging and shipping are my only complaints, as there is virtually no way to open the dang things without a heavy duty scissors and a lot of effort. The shipping took a little longer than I would have liked but that isn't the fault of the headphones! Sennheiser says that they come with a 2 year guaranteed warranty, although I have no idea how this would work since I ordered them from a third-party. Hopefully I will not need to figure this out. Overall, a great value and I use them everyday. They are stylish, comfortable and sound great.

Just got these yesterday. Coming from a Vmode headset, which the new puppy just chewed up the day I got the sennheiser set. So there is a God. When I first shoved them into my ear, I could tell that they weren't as good with my usual mp3 songs that I listen to. I could put my finger and push then in a little deeper into my ear and hear the bass a lot better. I decided to use some silicon ear buds instead of the cheap thin rubber ones that came with the headphones, and that made all the difference in the world. The silicon really helped. I think the bass bump is better with these, compared to the old ones. OK, they have the, one side longer than the other side, which for me doesn't work. Also, the ear buds just have the wire running into them, with no plastic protection, but there is extra rubber up to the ear buds. But all in all, after 2 days, every thing seem to be good with them. I'll order another pair, because you just don't know when you'll need another headset, if the dog eats it. I would give it 5 stars, but don't know how long the rubber will last around the wires, unlike the Sony set I had a while back, which didn't last that long.........Ray

As for sound quality, it sounds great. i still have yet to hear a pair of in-ear headphones that sound better (at least to my ears). you just have to use the right size rubber plug for your ear and you are good to go.

Comment:
I just got my Cx-300's in the mail today and so far I have to say I'm very pleased. The sound is, as others have mentioned, very tinny with sharp upper ranges and very pronounced bass, which isn't really a bad thing if you ask me. Depending on what genres of music you listen to these earbuds will be either stellar or just good for your music (alt. rock and rap lacks a little due to the somewhat underwhelming mid-range). The stock earbuds fit almost perfectly with excellent ambient sound (I was fooled twice into thinking sounds from within my music were from outside!). My previous pair of earphones were skullcandy's smokin' buds which I also have a very high opinion of. Compared to those these are at least on par if not better because they fit even more snugly in my ears. (and don't fall out as the smokin' budz have a habit of doing) So overall a great set of headphones for the price they sell for.

Header: Reasonable Replacement for Stock Earbuds, June 10, 2009
Comment:
I bought the CX300 to replace the stock iPod earbuds as I was hoping for something more comfortable and better sounding. To the former issue, the CX300 fit the bill. They are considerably more comfortable than the stock iPod earbuds and given the three different size earpieces, should be able to fit just about anyone's ear comfortably. To the latter issue of improved sound, well that one is not so clear. The earbuds do a great job of blocking out outside noise and certainly are far better than the stock earbuds at doing that. However, musically the CX300 is just not that much better than the stock Apple earbuds. I have used them to listen to rock, jazz, R&B, Pop, and Classical. In all cases, doing an A/B comparison with the stock earbuds, I came away much less than thrilled at the result. At times the CX300 showed a bit better clarity and dynamic range, but overall I found the difference to be negligible. If comfort is your primary requirement then these should certainly fit the bill. If you are looking for a great sound improvement over the stock earbuds though, I'd look elsewhere.

The moment I put on these earpieces I knew I was in for a robust sound. They're far better than the iPod ones that you get when purchasing the iPod. they fit cozily into your ear. Please note that one side is shorter than the other and I was confused about this at first until someone pointed out that it's meant to be worn around your neck. . . so they hang. And once I figured that out, I was totally sold on them. Very fulfilling sound. Highly recommended to anyone.

These earbuds are a great value. I know they have some drawbacks as listed by others but what do you want for the price? These are fantastic buds to use as an extra pair while traveling, at your desk, or when you run or workout. I have purchased several earbuds for me and my family over the years and none of them sound much better than these. I also need to mention that none of them were under $60. For a pair under $20 with this sound quality and bass buy two. For less than a third the price of others, in my opinion you can not go wrong.

I had Shure ear buds before but when I broke them I waned to get something a little less expensive to replace them. These sound great! I don't think they are good as the Shure buds but because they are lighter they stay in my ear much better making the sound consistent. With the Shure buds, I found myself constantly re-adjusting them in order to get the desired sound. The cord was so long and heavy the buds would work their way out of my ears. The only minus in my mind is the different length wires on the new ones. You have to run one of them behind your neck. Maybe some of you really like this but I wish they were the same length. All in all, I am very pleased.

I am thrilled with these phones. The ones that came with my iPod were terrible, but these improve on them in every way: they sound great, they've very comfortable and they block outside noise. My only complaint is that the cable is very thin and seems much more likely to break than some other phones. And personally, I don't like that the cable going to the left ear is shorter than the one going to the right -- I've never really seen the benefit of that, but it's forgivable. If you hate the phones that came with you iPod and are looking for a comfortable, good-sounding replacement, these are easily worth the 20 or so bucks. If I lost them, I'd buy them again.

Comment:
I ordered these because I wanted something better than the cheap generic ear buds that came with my mp3 player. They certainly have better sound and can create a better seal so that I don't have to turn the volume up as loud to drown out the noise around me. It may be just me, but I never realized how much having these kinds of ear buds would feel like being on an airplane when your ears are plugged and haven't popped yet from the altitude change; it took a little getting used to. I would give this a 5-star rating, but the size of my ears (or at least one) seems to fall between the sizing of the attachable tips, so I'm not sure if I'm getting the correct seal (which may affect the plugged feeling).

They are a lot better than what came with my devices, but even so I'll never use them. I plan to buy some Etymotic ER4P's, which are more sensitive than the ER4S's. The Etymotic are way more expensive than the Sennheisers but totally worth spending the extra money even for a guy on my budget!

Comment:
These inear headphones are quite good for the price. Good fit (right out of the box with the mid-size tips) and great sound. Isolate sound extremely well, have great range of lows to highs. One issue i have is that the cord is a bit too short, could do with another 6 inches or so so that if you hold your MP3 player low the cord doesn't come close to being taught. Also, non-symmetrical cords are just annoying (when the cable splits, the left cable is shorter than the right one)... this puts the cable to the side, but i prefer symmetrical cables. Best investment you can do to any in-ear headphones would be to get a way to clip the cable to your shirt; this prevents the issue of cable noise being transmitted to the earphones... I took one from a headset that came with my cellphone, works great ;-) Overall awesome earphones and stay put unlike my much more expensive Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5's which I still can't get a good fit with.

There are many wonderful reviews some of which get pretty detailed. By all means read them all. After I read them I could not decide between the CX300-B and the MX-560, so I ordered them both. My favorite is the CX300-B. My wife & I have matching recliners for TV viewing and they are the most comfortable chairs in the house. Whenever I really want to get into my favorite music I have to go to an uncomfortable chair elswhere because my wife is watching TV and she plays it a little loud. Now I can hook the CX300-B up to my IPod, recline the chair to it's best position, install the earbuds, close my eyes, and I am immersed in my music without any noise from the TV. If I really focus on trying to hear the TV during the silence between songs, I can faintly hear the TV. Plus my wife does not feel like I have dissappeared. It is like buying a new chair and building a new room for the price of earbuds. What a deal. Fortunately I am comfortable having these buds in the old ear canal.

Header: Sound Great, Design Bad, Left Ear Bud Pops Out Constantly, May 2, 2009
Comment:
Why do people get ear buds? For their portable player, right? You use ear buds on the go. Sure sound quality is important, and these have an impressive sound. There is a noticeable difference, the CX300 sound better then other models that cost about the same, $15. The primary problem with these is the left ear bud constantly pops out of your ear, comes loose. The cord on the left side is too short. It's not just me, everybody who has tried them says the same thing. Simply turn your head and the left ear bud gets loose and it will fall out. Put the left ear bud in the right ear, then it falls out of the right ear. It gets annoying. I run with mine, and I'm constantly pushing the left ear bud back in my ear. I plan my runs accordingly, treadmill okay, trail-run.... forget about it. An over ear hat fixes the problem, but so does using any number of other headphones with "normal" lengths of ear wires. Is there some mystery purpose for the left side being shorter then the right? Maybe answer phone left side, right side Led Zeppelin, left hand steer car, right hand adjust volume and settings, feet....

Header: Almost no noise cancelling, May 1, 2009
Comment:
I find that these headphones offer almost no noise attenuation / canceling. I work in a office where there is a lot of chatter so I wanted some earphones that cut the noise out. I had some Skull Candy silicon covered earphones that did the job perfectly though the sound quality wasn't great, so I replaced them with these. Unfortunately while the sound is better I can still hear all the people around me at quite a loud volume. This is even after trying the different sized rubber pieces and cramming them down my ear canal.

Header: Only for Inexperienced Ears!!!, May 1, 2009
Comment:
I bought these after returning a pair of Sony MDR-EX300 headphones. The Sonys were crystal clear. I was truly floored by their clarity. What they lacked was bass capable of handling an M.I.A or Jay-Z track. Took them back thinking, and taking a salesman's advice, that these would do the job. Wrong! The bass is fine but the mids are tinny, the highs are just ok, which makes for a very disappointing experience. Especially after hearing the Sonys. In addition the cord is built for destruction. On both ends you can wiggle the cord at the points where it enters the connectors. That will lead to a short in no time. One last thing, the sound isolation is bad due to the lightweight plastic used on the earpieces. I wasted money on these, warning you so you don't have to.

Header: Asymmetrical length of earphone cords annoying, April 30, 2009
Comment:
I bought this product because of the ability to change the size of the earbuds. I hadn't realized that the cords to the earbuds were of drastically different sizes. I clip my MP3 player to the waist of my shorts when I run and put the cord inside my shirt. I do not put it on my arm which is apparently what the product's designers assume. The short earbud kept falling out because it had no slack. I had to stop using them because it was so annoying.

These are great little earbuds for the money! I've had them now for a few wweeks and they work well and are comfortable. My workplace gets extremely noisy so I needed something to block it out. I put on music and these buds block out all the noise even at very low volume. The cord could be a bit longer, but I am happy with them otherwise!

Comment:
I didn't realize that these earbuds came with a J style cord. Everytime I wear these, the weight of the cord and or any jostling or turning of my neck causes the earbud on the short cord to pull out of my ear since the main cord hangs directly in line with it. Good fit in the ear and good sound but the cord is a loser and I will be replacing these with something else.

Comment:
Bought these buds for use with iPhone 3G after coming across a review of CX300's vs popular Sony buds. I was pleased with them from the first play. Great Bass response at lower listening levels which is just what I desired. Good Mid's and High's as well, with no listening fatique. Left this pair on an airplane to my chagrin, and realized that to get the full feature effect, I needed to get the Sennheiser iPhone version for both music and calls. Researched the product and found it at a good price. Can't wait 'till delivered. (Have also recently discovered discussions about fake Sennheiser products and pray that I don't fall into this category. First pair certainly the real article. Hope the upgrade version ordered is the same.)

Comment:
I bought these to replace my ipod stock headphones and was very pleased by the difference in quality in the sound. They fit in the ear canal so you do need to match the size of the ear bud to your comfort or they won't work well. Also, because it fits in your canal, you will find that noise can be transmitted physically from contact with the cord, especially when the seal is tight. I personally do not find this problematic but you need to be aware of this before buying. They are comfortable, relatively cheap and sound good. They are nowhere near as great sounding as my Sennheiser HD-555s, but that is to be expected. Sound is heard by the movement of air - larger displacement provides the means improve the sound so no earbuds will EVER outshine a great pair of headphones - simple physics. Great for travel; better than your ipod phones; good price. A worthy upgrade for your mp3 player.

Comment:
The sound quality and the bang for the buck makes these some sweet earbuds. The design is completely useless, however. The left bud has so little slack before the wires' hub that the meeting point hub keeps hitting my neck. There is TONS of slack on the right one, so much that you can wrap it around your head and still have it fit in your ear. The problem is the slack hangs down and starts to get wrapped in itself. From the hub to the plug, there's not enough length (I am tall and like to keep my IPod in my pants pockets, but still, take some excess Right earbud slack and put it there. Basically, the left one won't stay in the ear for lack of slack, the right one bunches for too much slack and I wish they had their act together, because the sound and bass are excellent.

The positves are: - fits my ear; they ship three earplug adapters one of which fit my canal well; can wear it for reasonable lengths of time without getting uncomfortable - blocks out most background noise, as advertised (I was a bit skeptical about this feature given the price) - very decent sound quality for mlistening purposes and for the price - behind the neck cord design; i lkethis better than the wires hanging below my chin I wish: - there were a carry case or even a clip of some sort provided with the product to keep it together when not in use

I bought these less than a year ago. The sound quality was quite good for my standards (I'm by no means an audiophile). Then the weather turned cold and every time I wore them outside I'd get little static shocks in my ears. This didn't happen if I was wearing them indoors. Now there is hardly any volume coming from the left bud. I was quite happy with these at first but now less then a year later I am very disappointed.

Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) These Buds sound great, have the bass fully covered and seem to be able to handle the power. I use them occasionally with various players, but I use more in studio and live stage monitoring systems (playing drums & bass) - the sound is great from high to low, the only cons are in physical design - the cord is too short; I prefer an evenly split cord design not the lopsided as these have; The stereo mini plug is a 90 degree plug - a straight plug would be better; And lastly the speaker bud could be just a tad lengthier. Yet they DO deliver in the perform department - They sound as good or better than any at 3X the price. I rate it 4 stars because performance and price is was important to me and these delivered.

I got these after the overly shrill high notes from a cheap pair of Sonys were giving me headaches - for the price I paid, these headphones are excellent. Very light, very comfortable and they add a lot of depth to my music. It took some doing to figure out which size earpieces to use (I eventually settled on the medium size), and exactly how to put them in my ears, but once I did, wow! My music simply sounds great with these. Several others have mentioned the bass - when the package said "bass-driven sound", they weren't kidding! On certain songs with these the bass is positively booming. This was a great buy. I'll be sticking with Sennheiser from now on.

Header: Impression of Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds, April 12, 2009
Comment:
I've owned this ear bud set for approx 3 weeks. They seem to perform similar to the standard V Moda earbuds which I also have. Given the street price differences this Sennheiser may be the best buy. 4 stars because I don't like the uneven cable lengths which go to the ears.... this reduces use flexibility(for my use); this also "encourages" entangleing when unwinding the cord from the body of the mp3 player when preparing to use. As has been noted in other reviews for this and other brand ear buds it is very important to set the buds in the ear canals to send the sound down the center of the ear canal. Mine were purchased from J&R and were made in China and were well packaged. Quality seems OK to me. I'm suspecting that all CX300's were made in China, but I could be wrong here. I recommend this product at it's street price of around $25 - $30.

Comment:
I ordered my Sennheiser CX300-B on a serious price limit and time constraint. My old apple earbuds (which come for free and break within a few months) broke and left me scrambling to find another pair of headphones that would not break so quickly. The reviews on the Sennheisers were so mixed that I almost bought a pair of Sony's that I'm familiar with, but I'm glad I didn't. For starters, these headphones are great for music addicts who listen to louder or music that flows consistently. They fit right in the ear and the earbuds come in three different sizes, so your fit will probably be in the box. ****People have been complaining about the static (ssssss) sound that you can hear, if there are breaks in your music or if it is softer, or classical, music.**** It is annoying, but I got used to it after a bit and it really isn't so bad. If you listen to a lot of easy listening or acoustic, stripped piano music, I would not recommend buying these. But for everything else, they're great. They are also pretty tough. Even though the earbud covers can fall out fairly easily, I slept on top of mine for a restless night on the floor, and they were fine when I woke up. They block out about 80% of the noise - 100% if you're playing something louder, so I think that's fine. I also like the sound quality - even though I have had to change some EQs on my music/iPod, it's been listenable, especially compared to the Apple buds. They fit fairly comfortably and play bass alright, especially for the price range. I think the people who are giving the headphones poor reviews are either 1) reviewing the wrong product, or 2) expecting some seriously great headphones for an incredible price. If you are willing to pay more than fifty or sixty bucks, go for something better. These won't last as long, and the sound quality will be better on the higher quality, more expensive headphones. My one problem with these is the wire - it's the cheaper kind of wire that is a little sticky and hard to use. But it's not so bad once you get used to it. So basically...go for these if you want a normal, un-interrupted musical experience with mostly pop/rock/alt/etc. If you listen to mostly classical/vocal/easy listening, keep looking unless the price tag is too good to resist.

The Sennheiser earbuds are much more comfortable that the hard plastic things that came with my Sony Walkman. I am able to understand the words of various songs better than I have with any other sound source. When I first listened to them I was a little disappointed....but, I adjusted the equalizer on my Walkman, and changed the default on itunes so my CD's were loaded at 256BPS instead of the default 128BPS....huge improvement in sound quality. The unequal length cord seemed odd at first, but I have grown to like it. I can easily identfy the right and left earbuds, and if you pull the earbuds out of your ears they remain securely on your shoulders because of the one cord that is routed behind your neck. Really not a problem at all. I have heard a bit of the noise from the cord some people mentioned, but it never bothers me because it's drowned out by the music. I'm impressed, and they were a bargain at the $20 I paid.

I bought these awhile ago because of the great discount on amazon ($35 less than list), and because of the great reviews. these buds sound *pretty* good, but i would have returned them if i had paid anymore for them. it is good sound for a price range around $20. the low and mid ranges are a bit "muddy", but clear enough to be listenable. the worst part about these is how easily they fall out of my ears, and how difficult it is to adjust them in precisely the right position to get any decent tone. that alone to me makes them not worth paying more than $20. for the price you can get better sound and better fit. just to note, the asymmetrical cables are really annoying. the short side is too short, and the long side is slightly too long. but, like i said, these things sound pretty decent.

These earbuds represent several generations of progression since the inception of i-Pods. They sound great with the entire audible frequency spectrum coming through with outstanding clarity. They block out outside noise quite effectively and really heighten the listening experience. They might not quite have the tone of some of their $100 counterparts, but for a fourth of the price or less, they're well worth the cost. It's like getting a better bargain earbud for less than half the price of a year or two ago.

The Sennheisers are amazing and the bass is fantastic. I actually hear things such as the Beatles talking to each other before beginning a song that I couldn't hear before.

Cons: the "Y" junction in the wires is up too close to my head, very annoying when I turn my head side to side... but nothing an x-acto blade and some electricians tape can't fix. Lows are a bit muffled, but I wasn't expecting much anyway. Note: I use these for working out, my first pair of earbuds so maybe they ALL do this... but the slights thump/touch on the wires is very audible. Makes it a little annoying when working out. I guess I'll just duct tape the wires to my chest tomorrow.

you'll hear people complain about the shortcoming of these buds from an audiophile perspective. But these only cost around $25 now. you won't find shures or etymotics for that price. the fact that people even compare the two is a real compliment to these buds. However, there is always a certain amount of personal preference that plays a role in reviews. for me these are great. so small, I can sleep with them in, the cord is just the right length, and they are very comfortable and fit nice and snug. These used to be $80, now the price hovers somewhere around $20. they are a great deal. I've been using mine for more than two years, and they are still in great condition. The Sony Ex51s I had before broke within a year. My wife was always borrowing them despite having several other pairs of earbuds around the house. so I bought her a pair too.

These earbuds have very good sound, especially considering the price. I compared them with a couple of other pairs that that I and my friend have that were of equal or higher price, and these had better sound. They are very comfortable, and the noise dampening is the best of any earbuds I've used. I use these w/my iPod in a fitness center, and they work great to drown out the TVs, music, noise from machines etc. They are very light, and the cord is offset (one side longer than the other) so you can drape it easily around your neck instead of having it dangling and bouncing in front of you. Some earbuds have a lot of noise when they bounce (like if you're jogging), but these are pretty good in that regard.

Comment:
I bought these to replace a really expensive set of Shure in-ear monitors I had been using to listen to my iPod while riding my bike. Wearing earbuds under a motorcycle helmet is tricky since most are too big and are not comfortable under the helmet. I bought these because they looked like they didn't stick out much and I was rtight: they fit VERY comfortable under a helmt. Sound quality leaves much to be desires, especially what appears to be a bass EQ bump engineered into the product. LAME. But if I EQ my audio tracks correctly I can get an acceptable sound. I don't expect hi-fi when riding down the road with wind noise, so I'm satisfied with these more for the comfort than the sound quality.

Header: Ok, but not as good as the J2 JBuds..., March 23, 2009
Comment:
I got these after trying both the original and J2 JBuds and having both of them die on me after a few months of happy use. The Sennheisers don't fit as well, despite having the different size inserts. They fall out of my ears way too easily with little to no provocation (like when I'm running...or walking...or sitting). This also means the noise-cancellation on them is wonky, since the seal goes really quickly from being near-perfect to utter crap. The sound from them is perfectly fine, though I still prefer the sound on the J2. I mostly listen to spoken word stuff, so my standards are pretty low and shouldn't be trusted by serious audiophiles. I haven't had any problems with the wiring yet, which is what ultimately killed both my JBuds, so that's a plus. In short, these are definitely a step up from your standard earbuds, but if you're buying from Amazon go ahead and spend the extra $10 for the J2s.

Comment:
I ordered these headphones over a year ago, and I love them. I'm not an audiophile, but everything sounds great on these headphones, I have hardly used my computer speakers since I've got them, I use these instead! Extremely durable, these poor headphones have been through a lot of use and abuse in the course of a year, and still function perfectly. The only negative I could say about these is the cable, which isn't so much a negative depending on how you use them. I primarily use these inside at my desk, so the length is not a concern as much, but when my earphones I use for my ipod when I'm out and about broke, I decided to use these. In that case the long cable is a bit of a bother, but they are still great, and usable. tl;dr: These things sound great, and will last.

Header: Light, Cancels Noise, Supurb Mids....I like already!, March 21, 2009
Comment:
I'll begin by stating that the pair I received were absolutely NOT counterfeit! In a short 2-3 days I am ready to make my first confident review in the Sennheiser CX300. I have never heard of this company before, but for years I have been a stickler for getting at least "good" audio quality out of my earbuds. My MP3 player of choice is the Zune and I purchased these strictly for for Zune 120GB...yes, the one w/o the built in EQ. Fear not my Zune fanatics, I am here to save the day! There is also a Zune 30GB (White, 1st Gen) in the household which belongs to the wife. This one was passed on to her as this one was mine since the summer of '08. I still suffer separation anxiety with that one mainly because that one HAS the built in EQ. I won't go into Microsoft "jibber-jabber" but i'll say that I am greatly satisfied with the Sennheiser CX300! For testing purposes, I used them in both versions of the Zune and I must say that the EQ WILL be the X factor. After listening to T.I.'s "A.S.A.P" with the "Hip Hop" EQ preset I could'nt help but smile with contentment of the lows & mids. The highs were surprisingly crisp for a Hip Hop setting, too! I then moved the earbuds over to the Zune 120GB, and to my surprise, the Sennheiser CX300 sounds pretty good with a "flat" EQ setting. You may be deterred by the other reviews about the mids, but I consider it to be an upgrade to the Sony's I originally bought last summer Sony MDR-ED21LP Fontopia In-The-Ear Headphones. Now, these had decent mids and lows. The CX300 has highs that are more crisp...not tinny! The CX300 also stayed put more with it's plugging ability. Don't worry, the cord is not to long and the fact that the right earbud is longer is no big deal. You supposed to run the right one around your neck for ergonomical reasons. They come with three different rubber add-ons to fit in your ear. The smallest ones fit in my canals and stay in well. Noise cancellation is above and beyond expectations. These are great...not perfect, but darn good! A 4.5 out of 5 at best!

Comment:
These earbuds have very good sound quality, stay in place, block quite a bit of ambient noice, and, for me, are very comfortable to wear. Although not as good at blocking noise as my Bose Noise Cancelling headset, they are acceptable for use on airplanes. Speaker effiency is higher than other earbuds I've tried requiring lower settings on my iPod to obtain the same volume level. My only complaint is the lack of any storage case.

Comment:
Noise cancellation is really top notch. I was looking for earbuds that were better than the run-of-the-mill ones you get as defaults or just buy really quickly in the store. Sometimes though, I can't hear the person next to me if I have one ear in. This is not terrible, but just saying. There is some "noise conduction" if you run or touch the wires. I'm not too bothered by this. It's a small price to pay. 4 stars because I was expecting a little more on the high tones, and this is really just bass heavy. Otherwise, everything is great. I thought I read that amazon said it was a symmetric wire, it is not, which is even better. Oh yes, and now I can listen to music in a noisy area at the lowest setting possible...which is really amazing.

Header: Good fit!, March 20, 2009
Comment:
I bought this item after purchasing and using about four others ranging from Altec Lansing to Philips, including the one that came with my Sansa Fuze. Finally, I found an ear-bud headphone that fits my ear canal perfectly and feels comfortable for extended usage. In terms of performance the CX300-B has slightly less sensitivity than the Philips SHE5920, rated best among the ones purchased, and considerable less base and acoustic dimension than SHE5920 also considered best in class. Depending on ones personal taste these latter considerations may be strengths or weaknesses. All in all, for me this item has proven to be a good fit acoustically as well as financially. The Altec Lansing proved to be weakest in every performance category, which is probably reflected in its price, being the least expensive.

Comment:
I love the sound these headphones produce. The bass is good quality. I just went on vacation and they were great to drown out the noise of the airplane engines. The value is also good. Only drawback is that if you run... these things will probably fall out of your ears pretty quickly. I exercise regularly so it was a big let down when I realized that I couldn't exercise with these earbuds. Besides that they are a good buy.

I am very impressed by the sound coming out of these inexpensive earbuds, and the comfort is incredible. The standard earphones that come with the ipod, or any player for that matter, never seem to fit properly and always have sub-par sound quality. These are the polar opposite of those basic earphones, not only are they comfortable, they sound fantastic for the price. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for a great product in the $20 range.

So many earbuds I have tried seem to pump up the bass so much it drowns out the music. I bought the CX-300's for the gym and a pair of 500's for everyday listening. So far the 300's have been perfect for the type of music I listen too and are well balanced. I put my Bose buds away and have really enjoyed the Sennheiser's much more. They are very light for workouts and seal very well. I haven't even tried the 500's yet. If you enjoy full spectrum music, you'll like these.

Header: Overly Hyped Product, March 12, 2009
Comment:
I bought this pair of CX300 from Amazon after seeing people praise how awesome it is. Even though I'm no audio enthusiast, I'm not quite satisfied with what it delivers. The bass to mid-range part is very fuzzy, and you have to use the "treble-boost" equalizer on your iPod to really get some clear upper-range sound. The only way to reduce the fuzziness is to use "bass-reduction" EQ, which just makes the "Bass-driven sound" feature pointless. And like many other in-ear earbuds, CX300 is not suitable for walking around or riding your bike. The winds and cord movements make pretty noticeable noises. Overall I don't think it's quite worth the price even if it's considered a "cheap" headset.

Header: Great for workout, not an high-end "headphone", March 10, 2009
Comment:
It all depends what you expect. If you are looking for a great earpiece to use during your workout or outdoors, this is the one. I tried Sony and Creative. Sony earbuds at comparable price were of lower quality: they kept falling off of my ears and the cable was heavier. Creative ones were of decent sound quality, but they hurt my ears because they are big. This one comes with three sets of flexible rubber inserts. I use the middle one and the fit is great. They don't fall off and they don't hurt my ears. They stay where I put them: just passed my ear canal's outer rim. As for sound quality, the middle range is somewhat emphasized (see the other "bright" comments). That is nothing that can't be fixed with a mid-priced music player: adjust your tone controls or equalizer and you'll be set. If, on the other hand, you expect sound quality as if this is a more expensive [full-coverage] pair, well, don't. That is not what these are spec'ed at and that is not the selling price range. Overall, the price/performance ratio is well above average and gets the job well done.

I'm somewhat hearing impaired and this is absolutely my favorite for listening to music. I have purchased several pairs of different brands and prices for my iPod, MacBook, and Kindle....and these are my favorites so far. I'd love it if Sennheiser would make one like this for tv listening (instead of my over-the-coiffure cans). My only CON was getting the buds out of that darned plastic container. Sure, it's packaged so that it's impervious to EVERYTHING, but I actually hurt my hand getting it out of the wrapper. You should furnish dynamite to open it. PS....I can't believe the price on these. They are worth at least twice what I paid!

I hate to say it, but I ordered these with much trepidation after reading so many feedbacks about the fake Sennheisers that are out there. After getting fake Sony MDR-EX90s thru Ebay among other cheap earbuds, I was getting extremely gunshy to order earbuds online anymore. Amazon came thru though with the CX300's I purchased thru them! After checking to make sure they were genuine (Google- "Fake Sennheiser Earbuds"), I tried them out and I was amazed at the amount of bass and quality sound separation coming from these earbuds. Super bass, great midrange and highrange. Highly recommended as long as they're genuine. For the price well worth it.

Header: Good but not excellent, March 5, 2009
Comment:
I pontificated for several months before buying these, due to fluctuating prices and scare stories of fake units being sold on Amazon. I also looked at Ety ER6i's, Ultimate Ears and various Shure units, but can't stomach the cost without a test drive. I may still get one of those sets if these don't work out. I finally decided to bite the bullet on the CX300 since the sound quality on my aging Koss "The Plug" phones has reduced to nothing short of appalling. Firstly, let me say that I am sure the pair I got from Amazon do NOT seem to be fake. They are beautifully made and have the proper, slim profile right-angle plug. I have seen plenty of pictures of fakes on the 'net and these look genuine. The packaging was also top notch. I would not consider myself an audiophile, but I like to think I know what sounds like faithful reproduction and what doesn't. I'm not a bass-head and I mostly listen to 70s-80s rock and pop. I'm an electrical engineer by profession and you won't catch me spending more than $[...] on any piece of A/V cable. My first impression of sound quality was "Ooooh! Tinny!", which surprised me as the packaging promised "Bass driven sound". However, after listening to and playing with them for a few hours, I actually think they're quite good. Remember, I have been using a pair of Koss plugs for the last 3 years, and the quantity of bass on those is ludicrous. [...] Getting a good seal on the CX300s is critical for getting the full range of sound. I have quite large ear canals (probably helped by wearing the Koss plugs) and not even the largest silicone rings supplied with the Sennheisers will seal properly for me. Also, the units are very small and if worn properly (with the cable hanging down), the short length of the driver body does not allow me to push the unit all the way into my ear. I found that the best seal and sound quality can be achieved by inserting the units upside down. The bass is then indeed quite present. Still nothing like the Koss's, but those were a "wall of bass" and altogether over the top. The CX300s have much clearer and present mids and highs than the Koss, but the sounds seem a bit mangled and confused when there's a lot going on in the music. So far I have only listened to 128kbps MP3 and FM radio with them, so more experimentation with a lossless source is needed. I will probably have to re-encode all my CD collection at a higher bit-rate now that I have better earphones. I also discovered (by using the University of NSW's online equal loudness contour applet) that the CX300s have a big response spike at around 6kHz. (I've run this test with all my headphones). I have to knock the relevant EQ slider down about 5dB on my MP3 player to make them sound natural and less squawky. One thing these are excellent for is listening in bed with one ear on the pillow. Since they are so tiny, they don't get forced into my ear like the Koss. I have left them playing an FM radio source for a whole day in case this makes them sound any better (I am skeptical on this) and will report back in due course...

Comment:
I picked up a pair of these a few months ago, because I was worried about leaving my Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones at work, and wouldn't be all that put out if these went missing. To my absolute shock, these CX300's are nearly as good. They aren't sound isolating, but they absolutely do reduce most of the background noise you'd hear in an office (including the always-on vent directly above my desk). More importantly, they sound GREAT! The bass is warm and accurate, there's more than enough midrange, and you really have to blast them before you hear clipping. Granted, these aren't going to make your skull vibrate when you're listening to music that would make subwoofers go in to overdrive. But that's not really Sennheiser's target market. I was also pleasantly surprised to find how well they fit with the medium caps. For reference, iPod earbuds are absolutely useless to me, and it takes much too long to get the E2C's properly sealed. With these, I just pop them in, and they sound great without falling out of my ears or needing to be constantly adjusted for the best sound. I'd gladly have paid twice as much for these. In fact, I like them so much, I came back to buy another pair as a gift.

Header: Best earbuds for the price, March 3, 2009
Comment:
Hands down, these are the best earbuds on the market for less than $40. They're a little fragile due to the thin wires (my crazy cat chewed through my first pair) but if you're careful with them around zippers and ridiculous animals, you should be fine. I tried the Jbuds after my first pair "bit" the dust, but they were so much worse than these that I relegated them to backup status and purchased a new pair of Sennheisers. The isolation is perfect, better than any I've had before. And they mold to your ear canal seamlessly. They fit so much better than the Jbuds, and are smaller so you barely even notice they're in, other than the fact that you can't hear anything but your music. They are incredible for commuting, the loud bus is completely unobtrusive, as are the passengers, when you have these buds in your ears. And the sound quality rivals my other Sennheisers, which were $150 on sale. I really love these earbuds, they are perfectly comfortable and do an excellent job blocking out distractions and producing quality sound, so you hear your music well.

I have had these for a few days and one gym workout. Compared to the stock iPod buds, the sound from the CX300's is tinny and lower. I also noticed that they distort at levels that are easily handled by the stock iPod buds. I have tried all three sizes of the cushions and none of them seem to provide a good noise seal or make the buds stay put. I also find that rounded shape makes them difficult to insert. When I try to push on the rounded end to seat them, they seem to go in the wrong direction. I would return them if I didn't already recycle the packaging.

Make sure it is well placed in your ear to get maximum bass. Not very good for workouts, touching the wires makes funny sounds. No carrying case. The wire is the right size to have the player in your pocket near waistline. And, avoid listening at high levels, you will damage your hearing over time.

These are definately better than the stock Apple iPod earbuds and more comfortable to wear. They do a nice job isolating outside noise come with 3 different size earbud cushions so fitting them to you ear should be no problem. The sound is a lot crisper and brighter with good bass report. The left earbud wire is significantly shorter than the right side, probably to differentiate the two or to provide better comfort when wearing them for activities. They are not overly short nor overly long in length. They have a rubbery feel and the wiring springs back straight without memory effect. I read some of the reviews here where they are compared against higher end earphones, some costing over $300, and these headphones are then given poor ratings. Folks, at the time of this posting the Sennheiser CX300-B's are going for $21.99 with FSSS. Comparing them to $300 Shure headsets is NOT a fair comparison! Yes, they dont compare to these higher end models but I didn't buy these hoping that they would. I simply wanted a better audio experience than I was getting with my iPod earbuds. I am extremely happy with the Sennheiser's and can only recommend them if you want to replace your stock iPod earbuds or any stock headphones for that matter. If your an audiophile hoping that these are going to miraculously give you high end Shure performance, let me save you the trouble and tell you they wont. But if your interested in a low cost alternative and upgrade to stock earbuds, the Sennheisers deliver an audio improvement without breaking the bank. Don't take my word for it, over 450+ reviews rate them at 5 and 4 Stars.. You can't get any better at this price so jump right in and get them.

Comment:
Back in 1988, I bought some Sony fontopia earbud headphones. They were one of the earliest varieties to have a silicone moulded cover that tried to direct the sound into the ear, rather than leaking it everywhere. I still have them, they still work, and I still use them. Ten years later I decided I needed a second pair for use in the office, so I went and found the nearest modern equivalent. As you can probably guess if you're familiar with how Sony's quality control declined during the 90s, the new pair fell to bits within a year. Sennheiser have been good for me over the years, so I decided to give the CX300s a try. They're one of the newer varieties of earbud that works more like an earplug; they're not as loose as (say) standard iPod headphones, but they're not as extreme as (say) a pair of Etymotic canalphones. I find actual earplugs fatiguing in my freakishly small ears, and this design is a compromise that gives pretty good sound isolation. They're low impedance, which means they produce plenty of sound when driven by wimpy amplifiers like the output stage of an iPod. The sound is better than my old Sony earbuds; if I had to pick a weakness, it's that the bass is rather ill-defined--Steve Lipson's guitar on the last track of "Slave to the Rhythm" is audible, but lacks clarity. Overall, the sound is good enough that if you're using them with an iPod or laptop, the headphones aren't going to be the limiting factor on the sound quality. (They do a marvelous job of reproducing laptop sound circuitry hiss.) At this price, I think I may have found my earbuds for the next 20 years...

Header: Good Sound Quality..., February 15, 2009
Comment:
These have great sound quality for headphones in the $20 range. For the most part they are solidly constructed, esp. the cord, which seems strong but light (at a drawback). However, they have a few notable points. * The silicone tips that go into the ear only come in three sizes. For me, the mediums have a hard time creating a full seal, but the larges pop out a lot. * The cord produces a lot of microphonics, especially when walking or running. The J cord means that all of this is directed into your left ear, unbalancing the sound a little. I've found you can wrap the left cord around the top of your ear to reduce this, but it looks a little strange. * The J cord in itself has its pluses and minuses. Just know that it isn't like a conventional Y cord. * Wearing these headphones for a long period of time starts to get a little unconformable. I suggest taking them out occasionally and letting your ears breath. The only problem is that putting them in frequently can make the ear canals a little soar. * There is no way you could wear these after getting your ears wet, such as after swimming, or a shower/bath. * The silicone tips also come off fairly easily. I briefly lost one of them, within my house, and later found it. I would hate have lost it on a train or w/e. * The sound isolation is quite good. When playing music, it blocks out all human noise, and a fair amount of traffic and other ambient noise (be careful while walking though). On moving vehicles, however, not all the noise is blocked, as a fair amount of it is transfered through your body or the cord, and you still hear it. * On the same note, it amplifies your body's noises, so that eating with them on is impossible, and its kinda gross to have a cold. On the whole, I would still recommend these as a very good value, but far from flawless.

Comment:
I couldn't be happier with the sound quality from these headphones, but that great sound quit working after 3 months. (I also had durability problems with my iPhone earbuds from Sennheiser.) Fits well: With the three sizes of ear pads, it is easy to fit them comfortably in my ears. Noise isolation: They do very well at blocking outside noise. I was actually at a postgame celebration for the Columbus Crew and was able to block out the outside noise and hear the audio at a comfortable level. FRAGILE: If it weren't for the terrible durability of the cord, I would highly recommend the Sennheiser collection of ear buds. Sorry, Sennheiser, you let a tiny wire ruin what could have been a near perfect product. Fail!

Header: Great headphones, unbeatable price, February 9, 2009
Comment:
These are great headphones and nearly unbeatable price. Pros: Great sound quality, very clean bass without drowning out any other sound. They are very comfortable and I can wear them all day at work without any fatigue to my ears. Easy to clean as the speaker sits back a bit from the silicon. No more ear-wax jamming up the metal grill. The sound isolation is GREAT! It blocks out most outside sounds without making you feel stuffed up in the head. Tiny, small enough to keep in your pocket without any discomfort. Classic, understated style. Better then those cheap brands that look like you have a machined metal bolt in the side of your head. Cons: They can pull out easily, however that is the trade off for comfort. Other headphones are more secure only because they push harder against the inside of your ear. Sound is heard when the cord brushes up against your shirt. HOWEVER this is NOT due to any electrical issue, it is actually due to two things: good bond between the cord and headphone unit, and vibration traveling up the cord. The effect is the same effect you get with two tin cans and a string. The sound isn't coming from the speakers, it is the vibrations traveling up the cord and into your head, similar to a "bone conduction" headset. This effect is amplified by the good sound isolation, which lowers the noise floor. To see what this sounds like put on ear plugs and scratch your ear, you will hear a similar sound to the cord noise. Most sound isolations heaphones will have a similar effect, depending on how heavy the cord is.

Comment:
These headphones are a quality set of earbuds that are much better than those that come with your iPod or other mp3 player. They have good noise cancellation capability and even provide a good amount of bass for an earbud. The cord on the headphones is intentionally uneven to make it more comfortable to have your mp3 player in your side pocket, but this may not appeal to everyone. Also, the cord is somewhat thin which may translate into it breaking a little easier. Overall, these headphones are good and are definitely worth a sale price of less than 30 dollars which I purchased them for.

Comment:
I tried these earbuds as a potential replacement for my beloved Sony EX71's which are no longer being manufactured. They were quite nice, but not without flaws... Build Quality: Really quite good. I have no complaints here! Fitment: The "medium" earpieces were a little bigger than the Sony or the Philips units, more in line with the Skull Candy earbuds. This means I wouldn't want to have these in all day, but that's a personal preference based on the size of MY ears! Sound Quality: Really quite good. My only complaint here is the overamped highs. The lows were good - really a lot of bass, as many of these premium earbuds with rubber isolating inserts have. The mids were good. The highs were just ... too much. I'm not 18 any more, and that's a deal-breaker for me. It wasn't bad, most people would probably appreciate the definition, but I had to pass based on that. Final Verdict: If you like definition in your music, these are definitely great earbuds!

Comment:
These are great headphones, listening to them right now. I got these for 19.99 with free shipping from Amazon. Just so you know...there are a lot of fake pairs of these for sale. Make sure you buy from an authorized dealer. Do not buy these off eBay. Sound is great. I love the highs. Very clear. The bass is very good too. You just have to make sure they are in your ears correctly. Not too far in..but not too loose either. You need to push them in pretty hard to get them nice and snug. One time I had them pushed in too hard and the bass was not that good. I took them out and reset them and didn't push them in as hard and they sounded great again. I have a pair of the $100 dollar Bose Tri-Port in ear headphones. These Sennheiser have better overall sound. Real crisp voice and highs. The Bose lack in the highs. The bass is about the same as the Bose In-Ear. I use the cx300 a lot more than the Bose headphones. These are more comfortable and do not fall out. Buy these. Save your money. I can't believe I got these for [...] bucks. Very disappointed in the $[...] Bose headphone, give me my other $[...] dollars back BOSE!!!!! CONS:: Only problem with these, as others have mentioned, is the cord does produce a lot of noise in your ear if you are constantly moving or rubbing on the cord. Less noticeable if you have your music at a reasonable level.

After reading the reviews I expected allot more out of these headphones. They have good sound isolation but that is about it. I was expecting pretty good bass since they are in ear headphones, but it is almost non existent. And when you do play some music that has a good amount of bass like hip hop or electronic music they can't handle it even at modest volume. Mids and highs are clear but nothing impressive, maybe even too high. Overall I was very disappointed. Don't spend your money on these people if you are expecting any bass in your music.

I bought these a month ago on a whim...I have a bunch of headsets, and I keep looking for the most comfortable set that sound good. So far, these seem to be the best. I also own a set of Shure E-2c's, which are much more expensive...and they sound good, but aren't as comfortable and don't deliver the bass that these do. I'm impressed to say the least. Right now these are the earbuds that I'm traveling with to enjoy solid sounds and keep the noise down on the BART in San Francisco. Anyone who has spent any time on there knows how loud it can be. All in all, I'd recommend these as a reasonble upgrade over any of the standard MP3/iPod headphones that come with a base unit. I'm done spending over $100 on headphones if these hold up like I think that they will!

Comment:
When first purchasing these headphones I wrote a very glowing review. I like these because they sit right at the edge of the ear, it is not difficult to get a good seal, and they stay in. They don't quite have the clarity the higher end ones do, but I enjoy the sound as it is warm with plenty of bass. On top of that, they are cheap. However, I soon found out why they are so cheap. They don't hold up well at all. My first pair lasted a couple of months, until one of the ears stopped producing any sound. I returned it under warranty, and received a new pair. After a month, I had the same problem, and returned that pair. My third pair gave me small shocks in my ear, right after opening it from the box... sweet!

I've been looking for some quality headphones to work out with for quite a while now. My Bose Triport's have pretty good sound, but they're just too bulky to work out in. A friend recommended the Sennheiser CX300's to me. I read a few reviews on them, and saw that there were a few frauds floating around, so I was leery of buying them from Amazon.com. So I did my research, went to www.sennheiserusa.com, and looked for authentic dealers. Target.com was an authentic dealer, so I went for it. I ended up paying $52 for them, but I was guaranteed an authentic pair so it's money well spent. Delivery was fast-- the exact date they said it was going to come was the exact date they came. About one week after I clicked "purchase", they hit my doorstep. All in all, The quality of them is amazing, and they block -all- outside sounds. My way of testing this was to blare my surround sound speakers to the max while wearing them. I didn't hear a thing-- so they certainly get my stamp of approval. The only down side to them was that I had a hard time opening the package. My scissors slipped and I ended up putting a cut in my thumb.

Comment:
My toddler son kept chewing off the foam from my cheap Sony earbuds (Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds with Winding Case) so I decided to step up just a little bit. Based on price and reviews, I bought these earbuds along with a pair of V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black (same price). In a direct comparison, I prefer the Sennheisers because they sound just a little crisper. They fit my ears right out of the package, frequency response is good and the bass is great, plus they seriously block outside noises (which could be a good or bad thing, what with a wife and child in the house). I would expect to pay more for earbuds of this quality; consider me very satisfied with my purchase. One gripe: The cord is designed to go behind your head, so the cord for the right bud is longer than the left. I don't like that there's more weight pulling on the left bud, and I prefer to wear the cord to the front. For that reason, I don't find them ideal for wearing while I'm active.

The sound quality is good as long as you stay fairly motionless. Basically, avoid any vibrations in your body (like from walking, running, etc) and avoid having the earphone cords rub against anything. Any of these actions will cause vibrations in the cords or in your body that get amplified by having you ear canals plugged up. Good for sitting at a desk at home as they do block out some noise. Definitely do not buy these (or I suspect any earphones of this style) for exercise.

Comment:
So i tried the shure e2c and i have always have had sony's, the sony's bass is way too over powering and i never noticed till i got this, then i ordered shure e2c, and was very dissapointed, it looks great feels great but has weak bass and over powering mid-highs and a lack of mids too, then i used the skull candy 'smokin buds' for a while, and they have great bass and mids, but the highs are a bit weak and they are cheaply made, i then ordered these, and was in love, great fit, design, mids lows and highs are crisp... my thing is that i have a zune 80gb and there is no equalizer so i want good natural sound and i found it and it was half the cost of shure, get these!

Comment:
I happened to catch these guys on sale and am happy with the purchase. I've owned some different types of the higher-end buds but they've all become damaged in one way or another, so I ordered the CX300's (pretty much out of randomness) and found them to do the trick. Overall they have a smooth frequency, good response and although the bass isn't "boomy" it's still present and alive. One thing to note however, the cord is a little short for these guys (barely reaches into my pants pocket) and I had to get a small extension for when I'm walking around or whatnot.

I definitely like the sound quality of these headphones. Bass sounds great, highs and mids sound accurate. My only caveat to these headphones is that I wish the cord was longer and the headphones were symmetrical. Having one side of the headphone shorter than the other really puts a cramp in my style. The overall length of the headphone cord needs to be just a little longer it's too short for my taste.

Comment:
I bought these a month ago after my old Philips earphones died. I've spent quite a while searching for a good pair of in-ear headphones that would sound great, be very comfortable, and cost at most 70$. I was stuck on these, and Etymotic's ER-6i's. I almost bought ER-6i, but when I borrowed my friend's pair I noticed they are not very comfortable to wear (they do sound great, but you have to fiddle around until you get the right fit), so I decided to go with the cheaper Sehnheiser CX300. The moment I received them I was surprised by their robust buid quality. But when I put them on and started the music player from my nokia n82 I was completely thrilled. There was a song in which it felt like there was a train running in the background, which I thought was some outside noise. When I took off the headphones I realized I was wrong, and that sound was just part of the song!! I was happy with the sound quality, but comfort is another story. These are easily the most comfortable earphones I ever had. I can't even feel anything in my ears and can wear them for hours... Overall I would highly recommend these headphones; They are a clear step up from the headphones supplied with iPods, cellphones, etc. And Amazon sells them for 32$! What more can you ask for??

I'll keep this short and sweet. I've had these guys for 2 weeks now, roughly about 30 hours of music I've listened with them. And hands down, these are the best earbuds I've ever purchased. Awesome bass, fantastic highs, radical sound quality all around. My only problem with these babies is the different lengths of cord on each earbud. I know they're supposed to go behind your neck or whatever, but It doesn't make any sense. I look retarded, and it often pulls on my neck if I turn my head. If these were the standard 'Y' style, I would slap these with a 5. Highly recommended, even if you can't take the stupid lengths.

Header: Revived my music collection!, October 29, 2008
Comment:
I've been using the standard ipod earbuds with my ipod for years now. I recently purchased an iPod touch, and while the included earbuds were much improved I decided to try some new ones. These Sennheiser's seemed like the best "bang for the buck" deal I could find, and I couldn't be happier! The difference in sound quality is astounding. Everything is so much clearer, with no frequency suffering. Bass is bassy, but not too bassy. Highs are crisp, and the mids cut through nice and clear. I'm hearing things in my music collection I've never heard. I'm not a total audiophile, but I can attest to the fact that these sound nearly as good as the over-ear bose headphones my girlfriend owns. Certainly amazing at a sub-$50 price point. The only thing that weirded me out was the asymmetric cord. Basically the distance from the split in the cord is much longer for the right earbud than the left one. I think this is to allow you to run the cord behind your head more easily, but it doesnt make too much of a difference to me. Comes with 3 insert sizes, i stuck with the medium ones and they fit great / are very comfortable for extended wear. Also provides decent isolation. I'd reccommend these to anyone looking for a new set of earbuds.

Comment:
I have been using earbuds for decades, and after reading so many reviews on the cx300 I decided to "upgrade" from my old sonys. like the product description says, it is bass driven, and it is significant louder than many other sound isolating earbuds around the same price range. What I didn't like was the noise level on these earbuds are very high. If you have a pair of trained ears you should be able to hear the noise once you plug it in and power on whatever the device you're using. Without the hitting the play button you should hear some background noise. Overall it sounds bass heavy and you are losing most of the mid-high frequencies. Not quite what I expected from Sennheiser.

The sound isolation is also amazing, but i give it a four because if you don't find a way to not let the buds bounce when you walk, it can create alot of thudding from the wire due to the isolation. Sound quality is top notch for sure though.

Comment:
After messing around with cheaper in-the-ear buds, I finally found the CX300's from Sennheiser. I really don't think you can beat the sound for the price. I've owned these for about 2 months now and use them all the time. The only downside I know of is that they transmit and bumps on the cord onto your ears, but I've never found a pair of in-the-ear headphones that don't. I recently used these on an airplane and wasn't expecting much in the line of noise reduction since they aren't active noise reduction. I was blown away at how much of the jet engine noise they did remove -- and that was without the sound on. Once I turned the music on, I couldn't tell I was on an airplane! These bass is great, the treble is smooth enough -- sometimes the 's' sound is a little tinny, but overall, I'd recommend these for portable use.

Comment:
Having never tried ear-buds before I'd often been suspicious of their sound quality claims, but I'm quite impressed with these little things. The clarity is excellent, the ability to produce bass without sounding muddy is fantastic, and overall I'm really just impressed you can get so much out of something so small. Some folks have mentioned a "tinny" quality as far as the sound output goes, but I've heard none of this myself. They fit very nicely too. I was concerned about this headphone design making my ears sore, but that's definitely not been the case. They're very light, the inserts allow you to pick the right size for the ear canal, and I must say the cord design is top notch. The instructions for wearing these are on the package, do yourself a favor and briefly look at those first because while I thought the concept was curious, the overall benefit of this design is clear. I have no issues with the buds being pulled out of my ear and the cord being supported seems to take the remaining weight off them as well (not that the cord is heavy).

Comment:
I recently received this item to replace the somewhat lacking ipod stock headphones. The first thing that struck me about this product is the comfort of the "canalbud" design. For me, traditional earbuds because excruciating after any more than an hour or so of continuous use. These buds have an almost foam earbud feel to them, and I've been able to wear them for extended periods of time with no discomfort. The sound response on these is fantastic, with respectable bass without sacrificing the mids and highs as well. Headroom's frequency response graphs show superior sound production compared to all earbuds in this range. The only drawback I've found so far is the thin cord, which is easily tangled and bent and does not seem to be very sturdy. Time will tell if this becomes a bigger issue later on. Overall, I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for high quality earbuds in a reasonable price range.

If you are working and don't have a lot of physical upper body movement these buds are great. Due to the short cable on one bud a lot of movement can pull it out of your ear. If you can live with that,I think they have great sound and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I believe they are a good buy.

I will be short: These buds are great and there is not much that could be criticized about these. Im not an audio-phile but I have used fair amount of earphones in my life. These are great choice for a very favorable price. Definitely must have if you buy your Ipod without having anything but the original earphones packaged with it (those are really horrible, bad fit into ear, dont isolate a jack, and the sound is very mediocre to say the least). 2 minor things I have noticed after using these for over 2 months: - the cord/cable could have been thicker so it does not entwine and tangle so easily. - the right bud's single cable is too long in my opinion, you have to pull it forward a lot to ensure it properly holds the weight of the cable (so it does not pull on your left ear).

I am using these earbuds primarily with my Cowon D2-08BL 8GB Portable Multimedia Player Black(highly recommended, had mine since January,no problems-- Ipod don't have a thang on Cowon!). These are balanced sounding with flat response across the frequency spectrum. This is not to say they don't sound good, they are merely accurate without having over-exaggerated bass frequencies. The price I paid $30 was very reasonable. Also, I applied for the $15 rebate through Sennheiser which will end up making these around $20 net, not a bad deal at all. Once again, I want to applaud Amazon's expedient service. Ordered on Tuesday with free shipping, received on Saturday. Thank you for making such a quality product available at such an affordable price.

I purchased a pair of Sennheiser CX300 earbuds for my Cowon D2 mp3 player, and I'm very happy with them. The sound quality from these earbuds is fantastic, especially for the low price. They block out noise very well, and have excellent bass if you insert them correctly. The downsides are that it has a very short cord, in my opinion. If I put my mp3 player in my pocket while listening to music, the cord was stretched almost to the limit. I'm not even that tall, just 5'7". The other downside is that the noise from the cord rubbing against itself is extremely loud and annoying when you're in a quiet environment. I don't notice it when I'm out and about, but if I'm studying it's a real distraction. Wearing the right bud behind my neck instead of in front minimalizes the rubbing to bearable levels. These earbuds offer excellent sound quality for such a low price. The short cord and cord rubbing noises are annoying, but not dealbreakers. Just be aware of those shortcomings.

This was my first foray out of the cheap "button-style" earbuds (which never, ever fit right in my ears). These are definitely much more comfortable with a tighter fit. I can wear them as I ride my bike to work without them falling out of my ears. They block out about 80% of the wind noise as I ride, which means I don't have to turn my music up too loudly. Leaving them in my ears for more than an hour tends to make my ears ache a bit, but I don't really need them in that long as I have some very comfortable over-the-ear headphones at work. I'd definitely recommend them.

Header: Excellent sound... not so excellent durability, September 7, 2008
Comment:
These earphones have some of the best sound I have ever experienced from an in-ear set. The overall quality is outstanding. They block out outside noise very well. I can listen to them while on a plane or mowing the lawn and I still don't have my iPod at half of the max volume. With the iPod stock headphones you have to pretty much turn the iPod up all the way to even hear it while walking to class, which shortens the battery life. There were some things I didn't like. One thing that I don't like about these earbuds is the stupid asymmetrical cord. Another issue is sometimes they can't handle all the bass they're trying to put out. At times when listening to rap or some heavy beats it'll sound awful. The major problems I've had with these is that they are not very durable at all. You will instantly notice upon taking them out of the box that they are extremely lightweight. The cord gets tangled very easily, and will stay a disheveled mess no matter how much you straighten it. A few months after I purchased them the little rubber pieces at the end of the cord near the buds started cracking and tearing. I had to put some electrical tape to those, so it's an interesting sight. Just today I noticed some wire showing near the 3.5mm connector, and it wasn't a problem at first, but now they are virtually useless. I've tried using electrical tape and even aluminum foil, but these earbuds are done for. I had them for about a year, and at about 50 bucks I'd say they're worth it. I actually just purchased a pair of Shure SCL2s to replace these. I'd be glad to update this once I get my new pair, and I'll compare the two. UPDATE: The wire near the 3.5mm connector is now completely exposed, leaving no actual rubber coating left. I've now lost all sound from the headphones, and I'm just waiting for my Shure SCL2's to get here because I hate walking around campus without music.

Sound - They have a really hollow, distant, muffled, artificial tiny sound....I let them "break in" overnight, playing all genres of music on Shuffle on iTunes..didn't really make a difference. Also give you a really cold, eerie feeling...can't really "get into" the music....The music is in your ears, not in your head. Sounds artificial even listening to music at 256 kbps. I can't imagine how so many people have raved about the sound...I suspect they are Sennheiser employees. Design flaws- Asymmetrical cords with no weight on the longer end...looks and feels awkward. Any movement you will hear the rustle of cords very loudly... don't expect to walk or jog with these on (you will hear the cords rustling anyway) The only cons I can think of are that they do isolate sound to a certain extent, but don't expect to comfortable listen to music on an airplane or anything.......so they allow you to listen to music at lower volumes, but again, the sound is so hollow, artificial, and cold...so even though they are cheap, they are 30 dollars wasted, as i resorted back to my standard ipod headphones. I continue my search for moderately priced headphones......I am considering V-Moda Vibe, Etymotic ER6i, and Super.fi 3. Can anyone help?? I can't really trust reviews anymore, because there are certain people praising each headphone saying this blows away all the competition....I'm guessing reviews were written my employees. Anyone who has actually tried the headphones, please leave a comment or email me.

Header: Better than iPod buds but not great, September 5, 2008
Comment:
First I bought the earbuds for $20 after shipping and handling on Amazon. I would not pay much more, they sound good, but not amazing and they have a few things that hold them back. First the cable is not very long, if I have my ipod in my pocket the earbuds barely reach my ears if the ipod is in my left pocket and will not reach both ears if it is in my right pocket. This is due to the shortened length on the cable leading to the left ear. The right ear is fine but not the left. Second the rubber they used for the cabling is very clingy and leads to random removal from the headphone jack. The earbuds otherwise sound good, but again not great, and the rubber earbuds take some getting used to inside your ear.

Header: Bass was nice, falling out of ears sucks, August 25, 2008
Comment:
Tried all three sizes of the interchangeable earbud sleeves, the smallest tend to work for me because they sit on the opening of my ear canal rather than hanging on loosely on the inner rimming of the antitragus like the large ones. The middle interchangeable earbud sleeves are too big for the ear canal and too small to hang on the antitragus, but hey, the bass is good. I like drum and bass or rock when I'm all revved up for cardio but the earbud with the shorter cord ends up falling out because it gets the most tug when I run. Neck-banded headphones are usually my preference but for those who wanted a review on this that work out and want to enjoy their music with the most effective equipment this falls shy. Also, why should I have to rap the cord around my ear on the side it falls out on? I do it anyways but should I really have to? Maybe a company should engineer a better earbud? I don't know, I'm just the consumer.

(I bought 2 pair) so I could keep one pair at work to help cut down on the amount of wear on the cords getting tangled & wear and tear, I am very pleased with them for the money, However if you are wanting top grade stuff you will need to dig deeper into your wallet to get the next level of earbuds, but at this price grab then and go, I found the sound to have good balance of bass mid-vocal and high end frequency, I am using these with my Creative ZEN, and the combination is working very well for me, you get a better appreciation for Music when the reference is better - I prefer 320kbps & nothing less than 192kbps also the volume you get with these as compared to the ones shipped with your player these will be a big improvement, for some the brand name of Sennheiser my not ring a bell but it's a well trusted name in the headphone industry from way back, and yes I have always liked Sennheiser, And I have owned a pair of there open air headphones in the past, so to try the Sennheiser CX300's at a good price was not a big stretch for me , I believe the CX300's are the first in-ear design from Sennheiser and they may not be their best model! But if you are looking to get a budget ear buds with solid sound quality, significant isolation from outside noise, then these are for you. Last note: you might want to try the new Zen X-Fi has better sound, features, headphones, and storage options than the Apple iPod Touch--and for a lower price, too.

Don't have the time to write a long review.. but I wouldn't be doing these ear buds justice if I didn't at least make a mention of how amazing they are. So yeah.. that's about it.. if you're trying to make up your mind on what to buy... I'd say go ahead and add this to your cart.. will not say it's "worth what you spend" because you get more than what you pay for... Wonderful sound... almost as good as the Grados I have... almost...

The original MSRP for these was around $80 and they are worth that. Now to see them around $30 IS AMAZING! Great low end (if you have a problem with bass on yours' switch the covers to fit snugly in ear). Slightly tinny on the highs but far better overall than most buds in the 30-70 price range.

I think that these are a good value. They sound good, and when I'm out on the street or on the bus they seem to block out a lot of sound. I'm able to play them at a much lower volume than my last pair of over-the-ear headphones. The only thing I would like to see different is that the wiring seems pretty frail, I'm not sure how long they are going to last. I would like them to be more robust. So far no problems.

Comment:
I bought mine more than two years ago. About two months ago one of the ear-buds broke, so I could only hear half the sound. All of a sudden three weeks ago the other one broke too, and it completely died. The durability is great, even compared to more expensive ones. I always have them on me, all the time. About six months ago, the jack started to fail. The wire got loose, but it stayed on though. The sound is good, the bass is great. My only complaint is that when you walk in wind, you constantly hear the wind noise and that really bugs me.

The headphones are nice for fairly cheap ones. They look good and having 3 tips is great when my wife wants to use them. The sound quality is only OK. Strongly exaggerated base and lack of clarity elsewhere ... they are nowhere near my Etymotic 4p. Finally noise isolation is very moderate ... which is good for using them on a street or at work but not good enough for public transportation.

Header: Outstanding bass, May 16, 2008
Comment:
I have never heard bass like I have with these headphones. They are definitely worth the asking price. Just a few things worth mentioning: These are noise canceling headphones so the cord transmits sounds as it touches surfaces, but it's not a bother and you will get used to that quickly. They are comfortable and fit snugly into the ear canal. The only reason I give these a 4-star rating is because initially and every now and then thereafter I would hear a crackling noise in the right ear bud. I think it would be imperceptible to most people but I was listening for it closely and paying attention. I haven't noticed it lately. This is my second pair after the first one broke after a year. The ear bud separated out and cord started cutting out. Although I blame this on eBay and counterfeit Chinese knockoffs of Sennheiser all over the web. So be careful where you buy and make sure you are getting the real Sennheiser, not a knockoff. Buy retail, Amazon or Sennheiser direct.

Strong bass that isnt muddy, no distortion, crystal clear highs and excellent mids. The provided rubber fittings are a perfect match, these do not fall out of my ears at all, they are nice and snug. Under $30 with express shipping on Amazon. $89.99 at Circuit City. This is a no brainer. I borrowed a pair of Bose Earbuds from my friend. He paid $100.00 from Bose and these are WAY better. I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these to anyone looking for an earbud style headphone for your portable music player. I use an iPod Nano Video and it reacts well to the different EQ settings I have for each type of music. I was using the garbage stock headphones that Apple provide and this is a 5000% improvement over those. Thumbs Up!

Bought these to use with my new iPod Touch. These earbuds are great! Had similar Sony in-ear earbuds but while these don't eliminate all the ambient noise, they do eliminate a lot of it. They fit nicely in the ear and are very comfortable. And the black color kind of matches the black look of the iPod Touch (if that's important to you). I also have the Shure noise cancellng ear phones/buds, but those are really uncomfortable and hard to put on. Of course, these earbuds are TONS better than those earbuds that come with all the iPods. Don't even try to use those. Spend a little money and get these. The price is very reasonable.

PROS: These are 100 times better than the little ones that come with most mp3 players. Great sound. They do fit tight, almost as good as industrial strength ear protection, so be shure you aren,t bothered by that "plugged ear" feeling. CONS: Because they are "tight", there is a certain amount of noise transmitted be anything that touches the wire cord like a rubbing collar, or even air! If I walk fast the air whistles around the cords on both ears. They would not be good for running. In a quiet environment plain ear phones are still the best.

Header: More than your average earbuds, April 21, 2008
Comment:
I dont have much experience with earbuds but I have used several pair in the last 2 years. These are very comfortable in my ear (after trying every style of tip for them) and they block out noise extremely well. Sound quality is awesome, bass is average to good (to be expected with earbuds) and they are extremely solid. Nice thick rubber, protected connections and a wonderful design: One side is longer than the other for an "over the shoulder" wearing style. Took me a while to get used to putting them on but its very nice to not have a cord banging on my chest/chin while running. The only drawback is that while they are solidly built and do blockout noise extremely well, the thickness off the rubber actually acts as a stethoscope, transmitting the cord vibrations right into your ear. Gets annoying while working out. An acceptable drawback when you consider how long they look like they will last.

Bought these to replace a pair of Shur headphones and I can't complain about the quality. I use them daily on the train into work. I don't think they are made as well as the Shur's, but they were half the price of the pair I replaced. Only complaint is that if anything bumps or rubs the cord, you hear it. Can be quite distracting. Sound quality is good and aside from things bumping the cord, the isolation is also good.

Header: Excellent sound, but ear stem flimsy, April 18, 2008
Comment:
I usually wear earbuds when I'm working out or cycling. I prefer the in-ear buds b/c of the noise reduction from the outside, snug fit, and the fact that I don't like the way bigger headphones fit on my head (and on my ears). That said, these have the same drawback that every pair of in-ear buds are stricken with, which is you have to fit it just right in your ear to maximize the sound, and b/c it sits close to your ear canal, it makes internal sounds (eating food, talking), or contact with the cord sound quite loud. I've tried several versions of ear buds, namely the ipod stock, ipod in-ear buds, and sony in-ear buds, and they all suffer from the same issue. Also, it's very easy for the rubber part of the earpiece to pop off, so be prepared to go hunting for them when they do, or find generic earbud rubber replacements. They sound better than the other buds I've mentioned, especially the bass response (the right fit is the key). However, despite the thicker than usual cord, the stem connecting the earbud to the cord is flimsy. After six months of use, my first pair wore down and the rubber stem detached from the ear piece, making it much harder to grab and place into the ear. If you like in-ear buds, want nice bass response and overall sound quality, and aren't really rough to them, you'll love it. If you intend to use these during very athletic/strenuous endeavors, they're probably not the best fit for you.

Comment:
I've never owned in-ear buds before, and it took some getting used to having the buds inserted right into my ear, but its obvious that blocking the outside noise with this method is so much preferable to electronic noise canceling. These earbuds deliver amazing sound, with excellent bass. In fact, on my Ipod Touch, I don't even use any of the EQ settings as the flat eq sounds perfect on these earbuds when listening to different types of music such as classical, rock, metal, and so on. It comes with different size rubber eartips to help find the right fit for your ear, I've found the smallest ones work fine for me as they don't fall out and have a nice tight fit. I listen to my music at work in a fairly noisy environment, and I must say that it really does block out distractions and allows me to relax to my music and work in peace. I can imagine these would be great on the bus or a subway as well. I don't how these sound compared to more expensive earbuds, but for the price, I don't think the sound can be beat, and are light years ahead of the included white Ipod headphones.

I am a relatively tough critic with electronics, and I have now owned several pairs of "noise cancelling" in-ear-design headphones. To name a few Shure SE210 and E2c, Etymotic, and now these. I find the full sound, rich base, secure fit and lighter weight of these to be superior to the others. I do believe the Shure SE210 offer better sound isolation (which is not the most important for me) and purer sound at high levels (also not for me). Regardless, I find these headphones to be far superior to the others. It would be nice if these came with some foam ear buds, but that's not a big deal.

Comment:
I listen to a broad range of music (from indie rock to classical to hip hop) and tend to be very picky about the quality of my headphones. This is the second pair of these I've owned (the first pair I lost), and I must say I have yet to be disappointed in their audio quality. One item of note is that when you receive your earbuds, switch between the different size pads to find the one that best fits your ear. If you use pads that are too small, you will get ZERO bass response and if you use pads that are too big, you will be uncomfortable. I only have one complaint about these earbuds, and that is the cord. For whatever reason, when I'm wearing these and the cords rubs on my shirt, I can hear it in the music. To prevent this, I usually run the cord under my shirt to keep it from moving around and that helps. Otherwise, for $40, I really can't complain.

Cons: The right cord is longer than the left and that's why the left one tends to fall out easy because it has to carry all the load. conclusion: for a little under $30 this is a good buy

Comment:
These are phenominal earbuds offering fantastic fidelity and bass response. A true steal for the $40-$60 price range. Just to be a little picky however, they are a little "amped" in the high end, so you are going to want to tone down your EQ highs a bit, too high and these can be a little piercing. Technically, its a good problem :) Also, I wish they had a 4th size attachments betweem the S and M... the smalls dont create a good seal, losing you a ton of bass, and the Mediums are a bit snug and can tend to create a mildly painful vacuum of the ear canal when laying down and rolling around. Yes I fall asleep in these puppies! If they were a TEEENSY bit smaller, I think they'd be a bit more comfortable. But all in all, you cannot go wrong with these buds. If you're thinking about getting Sony Fantopias... think again, these are the same price, but easliy a tier above them.

Header: You get your money's worth - and that's not a good thing, January 7, 2008
Comment:
I bought these to replace my Creative Zen (~$135) ear buds that broke after just two months. I was reluctant to spend over $100 for headphones that were so fragile, so I decided to go with the $60 Sennheiser's - big mistake. I'm not sure how Sennheiser tested these ear buds, but I'm certain they did NOT use human ears. These things DO NOT fit, not matter what size rubber cap you choose. The only way to get a decent noise isolating fit is to turn them upside down (with the wire point up instead of dangling down). This makes them prone to being pulled out, especially when exercising. They are just too short to fit in your ear. Most of the more expensive ear buds have a "corkscrew" shap to allow them to twist into your ear, not these ones. I agree with other reviews that the bass is terrible and there's too much treble. I've also noticed a lot of static when I touch the connector pin making me think there's a loose wire. The only positive I can give these is that they're cheap. I was more disappointed when I shelled out twice as much for the Creative's and they broke so quickly. For $60 I'll toss these ones out with the stock iPod headphones and consider it a lesson learned - spend the extra money if you want decent sound and design. Sennheiser needs to go back to the drawing board and study the human ear.

I bought these because of great recommendations. They are a bit tricky to get to fit correctly, and I tried each of the three buds for a week before I decided which fit best. If the bud creates a nice seal with the ear canal, the sound is fantastic. While not earth-shaking, the bass is rich and deep. The vocals and the rest of the range are reproduced well. These are certainly not Hi-Fi headphones, but given that they are buds, there are not much better ones out there for this price.

I purchased these for use with an Apple Shuffle that I carry when flying. The Apple earphones are ridiculous. You feel like you must shove them in to your ear canal, and they always feel like they are going to fall out. The Sennheiser fits like an earplug and they do a good job of blocking ambient noise on an airliner. This means lower volume levels to listen to music. The unequal length earbud cords were not something I was aware of when I made my purchase. I will never buy another set of earbuds with the unequal length cords. That is a really Stupid Idea. The sound is OK, nothing spectacular, but considering the size of the units I guess it's all I can hope for.

Header: Good replacement for sony earbuds, December 28, 2007
Comment:
Prior to purchasing these earbuds, I used the sony fontopia MDR-EX71 for over 2 years. I only decided to purchase new earphones because the sony was falling apart. I got them at a discounted price, which added points to the purchase, because it fell within my budget of 40 bucks. As advertised, the bass is really good with these earphones. Sound isolation was a lot better than the sony fontopia, I only had to set the volume on my ipod to 2 fifths and I could barely hear my roommate babbling. When set to half volume, I was blissfully in my own world. If the offer is still valid, and the earphones are below 40 bucks I would recommend that you get it. The usual price of 90 bucks is definitely overpriced. If you were willing to fork out 90 bucks you could do better with other earphones with better sound isolation and better sound quality.

Header: They FIT!!! They REALLY fit!!!, December 28, 2007
Comment:
I am an average person with a simple desire, to own a pair of ear buds that stay in my ears. As far as I am concerned they sound great and fit perfectly. I have read SO many reviews on SO many earbuds. I found several of the reviews commenting on specific sound qualities and I became overwhelmed. I took the chance and purchased these ear buds and I couldn't be happier. I use them when I work out and I have fallen asleep with them in my ears. I highly reccomend them to anyone who is simply looking for ear buds that stay in the ears and, in my opinion, sound good. I can not think of any downside to buying these.

This one is good...good bass and noise blocking.But the length of the left cord is very short.Hence the left earphone keeps popping out of the ear if I turn.The right one is fine. I have a zune and by using this earphones I get to listen loud music in NYC Subway roughly at 9 volume level.No need to crank up the volume in the device and it saves battery too!!!! But for the cord I like the earphones.

I found the sound of the Sennheisers to be very detailed and lifelike. Highs although maybe a tad bright, are undeniably crisp and sharp. The bass response is very satisfactory...before i purchased these i would have never believed a pair of earbuds could produce this kind of rich, deep bass. The sound-cancelling aspect is very good as well. Ambient noise all but disappears, and i found i could listen to my zune at a much lower volume than i had to with the stock earbuds. As far as comfort goes, I have fallen asleep wearing these more than once, and having them in for 8 hours or more left my ears with absolutely zero pain or soreness; they are quite comfortable indeed. My biggest gripe aside from the brightness of the sound would be the exclusion of a storage case..i had to get creative and make use of an empty altoids tin to transport my headphones. Other than that, I am very pleased with my purchase..enough so that i bought a pair for my dad for christmas (He was equally impressed). At less than 40 bucks here at Amazon, these are a complete no-brainer. Sure you can spend more, but unless you are a true audiophile, I can't imagine that you would need need much more than what the CX-300 delivers.

Comment:
Previously, I had tried a set of audiophile in-ear phones at about triple the price. I wasn't happy with them. I tried these and was happy, except for the lack of a carry case (where smaller is better). I agree that the selection of size is important. I started with the default medium size and tried the others. I thought the larger would fit better and tried those for a while. But, soon went back to the mediums which seemed to fit MY ears fairly well. The highs and lows are good. The noise reduction is pretty good, which I wasn't sure about from previous reviews. A recent 2.5hr flight made me glad that I had them -- enjoying the music and not even hearing the baby crying about 6 rows back (until I took them off). I didn't think that I would like the assymetrical cord length, but after several hours of use, I now prefer that approach.

The Good : These ear buds are very comfortable. They come with three different sized adapter foam pads. They sound great for an inexpensive set of earbuds. I have never listened to any of the higher end earbuds but with sound like this I don't see any need to. The Bad : I typically use my iPod when I am doing yard work and these have a tendency of not staying in place and I have to adjust them often to keep equal volume and sound in each ear. I tried changing to the larger adapter foam pads but it didn't seem to make much difference. Sennheiser also makes a set of earbuds with a wrap around wire that holds them in place better. I would only recommend the CX300 for anyone who is going to use them while doing lower movement activities and the type with the wrap around wire for more physical activities.

Could not maintain a good fit in my ears and they would fall out frequently. I do not want to trash the product because they do have a very nice sound. However, they do produce a "cable bounce" noise, which will not work well for runners. The other feature I did not like is the offset cable, which allows you to run one earbud cord behind the neck and keep your player in your left breast pocket. Nice idea, but I found it to be more of an inconvenience (personal preference).

I just got these in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised when I hooked them up to my iPod. MUCH better and WAY more comfortable than the stock Apple earphones. I lucked out; the middle-sized rubber flanges fit my ears perfectly. I'm sure I could get better sound from expensive, over-the-ear headphones, but for my purposes (lightweight, portable, and sound-blocking) these are fantastic. I would say to anyone that you have to play with the EQ settings on your MP3 player if you have the option, as I found the bass on these to be SO good that I had to switch to a vocal-booster setting. All in all, these are great earphones for the money.

Comment:
Previous to these earbuds I have used Sony high end earbuds. I find these to produce much clearer sound, and the bass, while excellent, is on part with the Sony's I have used in the past. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good 'value' set of high quality earbuds. I haven't listened to the CX300's or any of the SHURE headphones, but I know that these sound great. Perhaps not a good soundstage that a over ear pair can allow like my Sennheiser HD280's, but the sound quality is still great with clear highs and mids, nothing gets muddled. As for the type of music I'm listening to with these, it is mainly house/techno/electronica along with some rap, pop, and rock. One minor gripe is that the cord on these is fairly short and they do not come with an extender. So when I listen I'm using a 3rd party extension cord.

I've been using these earbuds for about one month. Initially when I got them I felt as if the highs were being played out of a tin can. I was very disappointed. I had some nice sony's prior to these and was about to go back to them. Then I changed some settings in my EQ on the ipod and the sound was perfect. I give 4 stars for the fact that the cord is short. I can barely fit in my front pocket and so generally I have to put it in a breast pocket of my coat. The quality of the buds are great too. The cord feels and appears pretty durable and does not get tangled up as easy as cheaper ones.

Comment:
The first impression I had of this earphone is that it's incredibly punchy when listening to modern pop/rock music. I also own the Sennheiser MX450, Sennheiser EH150, Etymotic ER6i, and the apple in ear headphones. I would rank the in ear monitors (from best to worst) Etymotic>Sennheiser>Apple. Actually, Apple's in ear headphones are so crap that I would not recommend spending money on them; the fit is terrible, the sound reproduction is tinny. I have always had a perfect fit with my Etymotics, and so far the Sennheisers have also been good. However, the Sennheisers win because I got them on ebay for $[...]. The Etymotics I paid for full price. Can I tell a difference? Absolutely. Is it worth $[...]? No.

These earbuds have good sound quality for the price. The bass is a little loose and can stand to be a little less distorted. This was improved by adjusting the equalizer on my iPod. If you are tall (over 6 feet) then there may be some problems wearing an iPod on your waist as the cord on these earbuds is kind of short. It can be done, but there isn't much slack left over. Overall these earbuds appear to be a quality product.

Header: Great Pair of Earbuds / IEMs, November 28, 2007
Comment:
These earbuds / in-ear monitors are great. I read through some of the negative reviews and even listened to my brother's pair of CX300s before I bought these and now understand that these buyers probably bought theirs from unauthorized retailers on eBay and received phony Sennheisers. I say this because my brother purchased his on eBay for about $15 from a Hong Kong seller, and yes, those are worse than any stock earbuds I have ever listened to before. The CX300s that I have, however, are quite exceptional. Of course, I will have to continue "breaking them in," but I only expect that the sound will improve after the transducer tightness goes away. The bass, mids, and highs are all exceptional, and any personal preferences for these can be adjusted with an equalizer easily. Also, the different-sized ear-fit rings ensure that nearly anyone can get a perfect with these buds. As for the asymmetric lengths of the two buds, the longer one (right side) is supposed to go behind your neck and then into the right ear to help you avoid excess tangling with the cords. This is especially effective if you stick an mp3 player in your left pocket. All in all, I can't say I have any complaints.

Comment:
The sound from these headphones are great. The sound is simply awesome. I like hip-hop music and the bass sounds great. With three different sizes for the in-ear portion, it should be easy to find a good, snug fit. The only reason I gave this four stars is the cord. I read a review that heavily criticized the cord, and I agree with it for the most part. It has a behind the neck design, so that the right ear plug has a longer cord than the left ear. This is a good idea, but the weight tends to fall on the left ear which is slightly uncomfortable. I don't use these nice headphones for sports, but I imagine this would be even more uncomfortable when doing exercising. The cord is also made of a weird material that is slightly rubbery. We all know that headphone cords have a knack of getting tangled up on themselves easily, but the rubber consistency of this cord makes it even harder to untangle. Also, the rubber material makes it easy to catch on clothing. For instance, when it is dangling near my arm, and I brush it accidentally, the rubber will catch on my sleeve and pull the earplug out. A regular cord wouldn't have caught. To conclude, you won't be disappointed by the audio quality. However, the cord really takes away from a perfect overall product. The downfalls of the cord are endurable, however, especially because of the great sound coming into your ears.

I love these headphones. They've given my Ipod new life. Far richer sound. The noise cancelling feature works well enough in most enviornments so you don't have to blast the volume.

These earbuds are for bass lovers but they also provide nice mid and highs. You might hear some wind noise and stuff when you walk in them but it goes away in a couple months.

I recently wanted to get a pair of either noise isolation or noise cancellation headphones because in my current apartment, the TV is very close to the computer, which my girlfriend likes to watch since we just finally hooked up cable. With the TV noise, I can't concentrate on any of my work while I'm at the computer. I decided to go with these because I've never spent more than $20 on a pair of headphones, and didn't want to spend much more than $50 for casual listening earphones. The good: The sound quality is great, although I'm mostly listening to mp3's of varying quality. The bass sounds really nice. I listen to drum and bass and other electronic music, so bass is very important. The ear pads don't require you to squish them and wait for them to expand in your ear like other earphones I've had, and they are really easy to get in and out. There are also 3 different sets of ear pads, so if your ear canals are too big or small, there's likely something that will work for you. The sound isolation is good, not great. I can still hear background noise, but the trade off is that they are much more comfortable than other ear canal phones I've used. I can definitely see myself laying down and falling asleep with them in. The bad: I kind of wish the noise isolation was better, but they were only $50 shipped anyway. I also wish the cord was slightly longer, but of course these are meant as laptop or mp3 player headphones. They don't come with a case or anything, which kind of sucks but who keeps their headphones in a case anyway. Most people probably just wrap them around their mp3 player. overall: Good headphones for the price. If you've found other in-ear headphones uncomfortable or hard to insert, these are probably for you.

Bought them based on the reviews, let them break-in, but still too shrill/bright for me. The Sony 51's, by comparison, need more high-end clarity. On a tangent, if you think your iPod earphones is bass heavy and lacking in the highs, make sure they're oriented correctly in your ears. That makes a world of difference! Also try using them without the cloth covers. In case you think I'm some sort of nut job with crazy ears, the best sounding headphones that I own are, IMO, my Grado SR60's.

Header: CX300 Earbud Review, February 15, 2007
Comment:
I think the CX300's are excellent. I'd initially bought a set of Shure E2c's, another sound-isolating headphone that cost 2x as much. However, they were a big disappointment as I found the high notes way too tinny. That's not an issue with the CX300s, which are half the price of the Shures. If you're not accustomed to wearing earplugs, these may take some getting used to. Also, you may want to run the wires over the tops of your ears (versus letting them just hang out) to keep the wires from knocking around, which mitigates the "tin can and string" effect. And you shouldn't expect them to fully block out all background noise. Nevertheless, I can wear them on the subway and they do a decent job muting all the background noise so that I don't have to turn my i-pod up to deafening levels. Two negatives: once you shove these in your ears, the easiest way to extract them is to tug on the wires, which likely means they'll weaken and rip out one day. Also, and I'm sure this depends on the user, the ear-buds can get ajar if you're moving your head around, thus losing the seal and changing the sound.

As a collector of disappointing, bargain headphones, the extra expense for the CX300's turned out be well worth it. Instead of thick bass and screeching treble, everything (I prefer classical) sounds great on these. There is some cord noise--no big deal. I don't get the uneven left/right cord length thing either--doesn't work for me. But the sound far outweighs these petty annoyances. Recommended.

Comment:
I bought these headphones because I've had prior Sennheiser products and I have always been happy with products from them. These earbuds delivered with everything I was expecting. The sound quality is excellent, the bass, volume and the one qualifying factor that I bought them for, sound blocking. I would have given them a perfect score but the only thing I don't like about them is the "J" style cable. It may just be me but I still can't seem to get used to it and the left side is way too short to be comfortable without getting tugged out. But other than that, great product and worth the money.

I've owned several of Sony's versions of this style headphones but this Sennheiser set blows them all away. Much better bass response, clarity and construction (the Sony wires jackets erode quickly). You will not find a better earbud for the price.

Header: Decent sub-$50 headphones (with one caveat), October 5, 2006
Comment:
(VINE VOICE)
*** Edit 04/2008 - after purchasing some more expensive headphones in the past two years I now find the CX300s too "boomy" in the mid-bass for my liking. But considering the comparable products (Senn HD595s, Denon C751s) sell for 3x to 5x the current price of the CX300s, the CX300s are still a good deal. I originally rated these 5 stars, now I have to give only 4 stars due to the unnaturally boosted bass. Compare to Denon 551s if you are interested in reasonably priced headphones with less bass boost and a bit more balanced sound. *** Original review 10/2006 - I've recently bought several pairs of headphones to go with my IPod and AM/FM pocket radio (and replace an ancient pair of Koss Pro 4X full size headphones, a few sets of junker headphones and earbuds, and marginal-at-best stock IPod earbuds). My favorite of these is the Sennheiser CX 300. First, these Inner Ear Monitors (IEMs) cut out a good deal of external noise. This makes these useful for airplanes, buses, cutting grass, etc. It also makes these less bothersome to those around you than an "open design" which leaks sound. The bad part is that there are microphonics with this unit. When the lead wires bounce against you you hear it; a stong breeze can produce a whistling sound in your ear; you may hear your own footsteps / breathing / gum chewing / etc. Some of this is true for any IEM, but perhaps something with the Sennheisers acccentuates this. As for the sound, these are the best heaphones I've heard in this price range. (I have not auditioned more expensive IEMs like the Shures / Etys or more expensive full size headphones like the Grado SR-60.) There is a complete range of sound from full deep bass to sizzling highs; the deep bass is boosted a bit, but it doesn't come off as "boomy" or unnatural to my ears. The midrange may be a bit recessed, but not enough to cause any problems, and for me at least I prefer a "recessed" midrange to a bigger "in your face" sound. In all, I really like the sound of these. And the efficiency of these phones is very good, so I wouldn't expect to have trouble driving these with any portable MP3 / radio. As to the fit, I have absolutely no trouble getting a good fit with these IEMs (a pair of less expensive JVC IEMs I also bought recently are trickier to get a good seal). And with any IEM, if you don't get a good seal, you will get *no* bass. (I suspect that most negative reviews here saying "tinny sound" or "no bass" were due to a poor fit that might have been corrected by using a differnt size earpad). Notes: These feature a "J" cord, where the right cord is significantly longer than the left; personal preference whether this is a good or bad thing. One oversight is the lack of a storage case (I've found the CX-300s just fit into a small Altoids chewing gum tin). Overall, a excellent set of IEMs; if you want any better you are going to have to pay at least twice as much.

Comment:
Great sound for design type. Great price point. Surprisingly good imaging for design type. I have owned the Sony 71s and thought they were a great bargain, and then i was introduced to these after reading some recommendations on this site. These headphones are very efficient and accurate, and don't tangle anywhere near the level the Sony's did. Incredibly comfortable. Good bass levels. If the Sony's fit your ear, these will as well. I have tried the Shure and Eytomics... (I owned the ER-6s) and while some of their headphones are great, the price point is at a level where you have to take care of those headphones... At 50$ the Sennheisers you can throw in your pocket and not worry about for everyday use. I highly recommend.

Header: Great sound, horrible cord, June 8, 2006
Comment:
I have loved the sound of these since I bought them over a month ago. The best sounding ear buds I have ever heard. However, the model has two exceptional drawbacks. First, they use that style of one line to one ear being longer to the others, which means that the weight of the cord, while not substantial in general, hangs on one ear. This makes this sort of model really awful for anything athletic, as the bouncing of the cord puts the weight on the plug in one ear, which is annoying to feel and also much more likely to have it come loose while you are running, etc. Basic iPod buds, or apple, seem to have always known better than to do this dumb arrangement, using the standard Y shaped cord of equal length from ear to ear. Second, and worse, the cord itself is made of a kind of kinky rubber/plastic that keeps curling up and not hanging smoothly and easily. This combined with the fact of the uneven length of cable from ear to ear makes the cord often kink up and rub on your neck. You virtually cannot make it stop doing this. I have found I love these if I'm wearing a dress shirt but hate them when wearing a t-shirt for the constant inability of the cord to lie flat and without notice. So, in sum. Awesome sound. Great company. Excellent build. Horrible cord design and material. So bad, I can no longer stand to use them. I'm back with the basic Apple ear buds. UPDATE: Get the Shure e2's. Wonderful sound (Just like the Senn's) but amazingly well made, including the best quality cords I've ever seen on any ear buds. They are strong, well constructed, and wear and feel good.

Buyer beware if you do ANYTHING else with your MP3 player other than sit motionless in a chair: 1) Any slight motion transmits noise from the wires straight to your ears. This seems to be a common problem with "in ear" earbuds. 2) When the earbuds are securely in your ear, you can HEAR every step you take. The act of your heels striking the surface is trasmitted as a pretty lound sound to your ears. 3) The air turbulence that a simple act of walking creates around your ears can be heard lound and clear. Do a simple experiment - put them in your ears, then take a brisk walk. As you take each step forward, you will hear the "wind" whistling around your ears. Now put your hands in front of your ears so they act like car spoilers and compare the noise - it is gone. I can't imagine trying to run in those. And no, I don't have floppy ears. All these problems go away immediately if you back out the buds out of your ears a bit, but then the bass disappears and the sound become about equivalent to the tinny iPod earbud sound. Having said all this, when you are sitting down and listening to music with the buds firmly in place, the sound is pretty good, especially given the price.

Header: Same as the EP-630, May 23, 2008
Comment:
The Sennheiser CX300-B are good headphones, I but give the product 3 stars for a couple reasons. First off, these headphones deliver almost exactly the same quality as the Creative Labs EP-630. If you buy the Sennheiser over the Creative Labs, you are getting slightly more bass, and that is it. For around $50, compared to $30, paying 20 more dollars for a slight increase in bass is not worth it. I wouldn't mind if this was an overall better product, but it isn't. This is mostly a personal reason, but I don't like the "J" cord. The left headphone is much shorter, as the right cable is supposed to go around behind your neck. I find it weird, as all my other headphones have the "Y" cables. I also don't really care for the hooked plug in jack. I prefer headphones that have a straight jack. If you want to get your money's worth, buy the Creative Labs EP-630. It's almost the exact same headphone for a cheaper price.

I found the Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds to be vastly overrated. On sale at about twenty bucks, the loss didn't really break my budget but this is a piece of genuine crap sold by a highly respected sound manufacturer that does not usually miss the mark like this. There are Memorex earbuds available at WalMart for less than five dollars that are every bit as good a product as this. Mine hit the trash shortly after I tried them. Don't waste your money!

Comment:
Like how my title says, the way I feel about these earphones are both good and bad at the same time. Let me start off with saying that I am 99% sure that I got the genuine pair directly sent by Amazon. How do I know this? these earphones has a great bass, at least compared to the generic ipod earphones, and I know (from reading various reviews about Sennheiser CX300-B, specially related with detecting the fake ones) that one of the biggest signs that this earphone can be fake is when it lacks a good bass. Finally, before I say anything, I will concentrate on only sound quality. But I will say that in general, the material quality of these earphones seems to be good enough by most standards, but they are certainly not sturdy nor likely to be fall apart in 3 months. So, let's start with the pros. It has a good bass. The sound is more "full" as in, it sound as if you were standing directly by a recording studio in recording progress. Just because of these "full" sound, anyone WILL easily feel the difference between an average earphone (generic ipod earphone), and a relatively cheap sound cancelling earphone (the cx 300, the one I am reviewing). Now the bad part. The "full" sound is not necessarily a good thing: the sound is less clear than your average earphone. Perhaps this flaw is due to the sound canceling nature of the earphones (for example, close your ears with your hands, and you will hear some little noise which sounds like "stillness", AT THE SAME TIME feeling that your listening ear has less freedom). Either way, the sound you will hear is significantly less clear because your ear has been closed completely and it is distracting. The other problem is, when you touch the cord, you will hear the distracting sound. Just imagine: if you talk while you have your ears covered, you can hear yourself better and when you hit the microphone lightly, then you will hear its noise via speakers. The noises that I described are similar (maybe not as bad, but still, they are connected to your ears!) from what you will hear when your cords are hit lightly. Maybe my hearing is sensitive, but I really hate those distracting sounds. In all, if you are looking for a good bass earphone with "full"(3D-ish) sound, while you are not planning to move much when using the earphone, AND can tolerate the "stillness" sound when you cover your ears completely, THEN I would fully recommend these earphones. But if you are like me, someone who likes to listen music at night (when everything is more quiet, and all the distracting sounds are more noticeble) at low volume, and clear sound is more important than bass, then I cannot possibly recommend these earphones.

I have been a musician for over 30 years, built and operated PA systems, worked professionally as a sound man and have spent a lot of time in studios, I know what I am listening to. These were better than the trash that comes with most MP3 players, but they really were very underwhelming, the bass was non existent in my opinion. Save your money, go to walmart and buy the $16.00 Phillips "virtual surround" vented ear buds, they are much better unless you want total isolation. I don't want isolation, I would like to hear the truck that is about to run me over... But all that aside, the Phillips were the best out of 5 models I tested including the V-modas.

Header: CX300 vs e2, March 29, 2007
Comment:
I bought these to replace my Shure e2's that broke in a rolling chair accident so I have something to compare them to. I don't like the fit of the CX-300s as much as the e2s, they seem to fall out way more often. I also don't like the fact that the cord is way less insulated so you her a lot more background noise from the cord brushing against other things. In terms of sounds, they're okay, nothing spectacular, but I think one of the reasons for that is the poor fitment. Once I get them in correctly, they sound almost as good as the e2s. Overall, if I had to make the purchase again, I would have gone with the e2s. Hope this helped...

Header: A great headphone with a very flawed cord, June 29, 2010
Comment:
Everything that has been said about the sound is correct in the previous reviews. But I'm surprised that more people don't complain about the excessive length of the one side of the 'V' headphone (where one side is much longer). It is literally so long that you could wrap it around a basketball. This makes it very cumbersome for use at the gym, running, etc, where it is always catching on stuff or getting in the way. It is the one glaring flaw that is causing me to sell these and go back to my other phones.

Comment:
Excellent product for podcasts--in bus, light rail, car, it's possible to hear podcast without blasting the volume. Very comfortable to use--much more comfortable than Apple's earbuds. Oddly imbalanced in length: 33" plug to split; split to left earbud 12"; split to right earbud 20". The idea is that you carry your player on your left side and run the longer right cord around the back of your neck. Has a tendency to pop out of ear when cord catches on something because of different lengths. Right wire failed after 9 months, then the left shortly afterwards (both at the plug), but I'll try to replace it under warranty or buy a new one. Very happy with it.

Comment:
Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) I recently purchased Sennheiser's CX300 Earbuds. My son is really into computers and new innovative devices. He recommended that I do some investigation in sound isolation earbuds. After reading several reviews, I found the Sennheisers that I was interested in. After reading several reviews about the Senheisers, I decided this was the product that I wanted to buy. I am in the music education business, and I have had excellent success with Sennheiser products, so I thought why not give their earbuds a try. At this price, how could I go wrong? I am a real musical prude -- if it's not Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, (you get the picture), I probably won't listen to it more than once. I also workout in a gym where the latest pop music is constantly played. With my Sennheisers, I won't have to ever hear the words, "she moves her body like a cyclone, if you like it then you should have put a ring on it, and my all time favorite (just kidding) I kissed a girl -- I liked it." These earbuds isolate the sound so well, that I can play my music on my refurbished ipod nano at a reasonable volume level and block out 90% of the gym music. I really look forward to my workouts, and even more now that I can listen to my preferred classical music. This is an excellent product at an excellent price, and it does exactly what I need. I love my music and I love my new Sennheiser CX300 Earbuds!

It doesn't work for me, and I would have gladly paid more money for something without it. If I had known in advance I would not have purchased these headphones.

Comment:
Sound quality is good enough for the price. Isolation is okay, but not as good as Shures. Despite its good features, I cannot get over its problem- wires break VERY easily. Since these don't come with bags like the Shures, I couldn't keep them in perfect condition, but I certainly never abused them. Nevertheless, I've had wires break TWICE, and it seems to be a pattern; I also saw complaints online about this issue so I'm not alone. While cheap earphones are nice, I'd rather have one that lasts. Shures, although expensive, are completely worth the price difference for their superior isolation, better build quality, and the protective equipment that comes with it. So in conclusion, I will never buy Sennheiser's cheap earphones again.

If you are committed to not moving one inch when using these they may be a good choice but......

i have some other, cheap earbud headphones, and the most noticeable pros to these is they have much better base, offer better sound clarity and block out outside noises. now, it may have better sound quality because it blocks out the outside noises, so i wouldnt say these are super amazing or anything, but they definitely improved my listening experience. i use these when im running/jogging on the treadmill. people have complained about the wires making too much noise to be used for any "active" listening, but if you just tuck the cable into your shirt or sweater, it removes any noises. also, i think some of them confuse the sound of your body hitting the floor with the sound of the cable hitting your clothes, because hitting the cable directly doesnt make that much noise, but because they isolate so well you can hear all the noises within your body pretty clearly (chewing, chomping, stomping, joint cracking, etc.). i can hear my heartbeat with these things on if my heart rate goes up while running, and thats because they block other noises so well. i think theyre perfectly fine for running, and i didnt like the j wire at first, but i got used to it, putting it behind my neck. works good. good headphones.

Comment:
These were purchased as a replacement for a pair of Sony EX70 earbuds that I'd had for 6 years or so but had lost sound in one bud. I did a lot of research and got recommendations for the Sennheiser CX300, so I put them on my wishlist and received them for Christmas. The following day I excitedly tried them but was left disappointed. Right from the start there was a hissing in the background, even before any sound was playing. When the sound kicked in the hissing got louder and is louder than 90% of the things I play, be it radio, music or movies. The sound itself is average. The bass is OK but no where near as good as the old Sony's, the treble is a little tinny and the mid range is a little muddy. None of the sound is particularly terrible, just not as good as I was used to. I emailed Sennheiser to ask them about the hissing but never received a response other than the auto response. Some people have told me that my problems are because they don't fit and if I use the correct bud it will be fine. However, I never had the problem with my Sony set of the same design and I've actually ended up using the buds from them as they give me the best sound out of them and the ones Sennheiser give you. I've given the earphones a good 3 weeks to see if things get better but if anything, it's worse and I've waited over a week for a reply to my email. Either I got a bad pair or these are just a bad product. Either way Sennheiser don't seem to be bothered about it. If I was blind testing the set I have, I would put a price of $10-15 on them. I have emailed Amazon to see if they can do anything but due to them being a gift and me not having the order or packaging anymore I doubt there is anything they can do. I have just ordered a set of Sony EX71's that will hopefully perform like the EX70's I had before, although because of this experience I won't hold my breath. Bottom line, don't buy these unless you have used the pair you are buying and are happy with the way they perform. I will not be considering another Sennheiser product based on this experience.

Comment:
The earbuds sound very good. They have different length cords to the buds wthich is not a good idea. The longer cord tends to get in the way and be somewhat cumbersome. The fit is good the sound is very good though.

these are awesome for the price. i recently tried the bose earbuds to compare to these and the bose ones were crap. these earbuds block out outside sound while playing music clearly at a much lower volume! the bass is good and for the price these can't be beat! they do have a weird cord, one side is shorter. if youre a lefty ipoder you're ok but if you wear it on the right it gets the cord a bit askew!

These seemed like very good value when I first bought them. But although they're still under warranty (three months into the two-year warranty period) I won't be going back for my fourth replacement. They seem to last for about three weeks of moderate use before the left channel dies, no matter how carefully they're looked after. If they were more robust I'd recommend them as a decently priced and decently performing replacement for iPod standard buds, but they're disappointingly ephemeral.

Great sound... search eBay and you can find them new for around $25.00 S/h included. Regarding the left/right size difference... you are supposed to wrap the longer (right) cord behind your neck to the right ear. This allows it to hang on your neck when you take the ear-buds out of your ears.

Header: Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds, February 23, 2007
Comment:
Early on, I bought these earphones because people stated on various reviews that they were great! Well... my experience was completely different! The cords have a J-type cable so one end is shorter than the other and is meant to wrap around the user's neck while the cord travels down one side of the body instead of the middle. Also, the cable is SO thin that there is (forgot the technical term for it but there is one) an echo and vibration that travels through the cable. MANY people on various forums have noted this, probably the result of thin metal cables, light rubber insulation or both. The reverberation of the cable feedback is SO annoying and can be quite load, even if you're walking slowly. The noise is heard even when the cable gently sways lightly. The earbuds do NOT isolate noise, as compared to earphones from Shure or other high earphone brands! Also, the construction is so light that the cable and wiring tore near the earbuds that I had to send them back for a replacement. I've since put the new and sealed replacements away and it's sitting somewhere gathering dust! I've lost my investment as the value of the earphones dropped. Most people can buy it online for ~$20 but I bought it when it was near retail ~$50! Shure earphones are my preference now, especially the SC-4, now called the SCL-4 model. It cost much more but worth every penny! Literally! The guarantee is terrific and the sound isolation is one of the best! The Sennheiser CX300-B(lack) Earbuds should be avoided at all costs! Be very skeptical of other people's reviews as many reviewers get carried away with their emotions instead of putting an unbiased review of how products actually function!

I bought these the same time my girlfriend bought her Bose in-ear headphones. She paid $40 more for hers. What a sucker! I'm talking about me, not her. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $40. The mids and highs are pretty nice, but the CX300's do not offer a good bass sound. Just remember, you get what you pay for.

Produces the type of sound you expect from Sennheiser....high quality with deep rich bass and clear high notes. The earbuds straight from the package fit like a charm & again produced sound that rivals more expensive IEM's. By the way, I also own a pair of Shure Ec3's and a set of the Sennheiser PCX 250's ( which I dearly love ) but I got to tell you I think this little gem outperforms both, but this is just one man's opinion. You just have to try for yourself and form your own opinion. The cord setup is a little strange as noted by many others, but hey, the output more than compensates for the shape of the cord. The CX-300-B ( black ) is the bomb !!!!!!

Comment:
I've got to say that I am pretty disappointed in these. As most people who bought these I was looking to upgrade the sound quality of my ipod. But, these disappoint. I had previously bought Griffin Ear Jams that have a little plastic piece that goes over the ipod earphones earbud and you mount the little rubber pieces on them. For $15 I thought they worked well which is why I bought the Sennheiser which worked on the same principle. In short, the Sennheiser don't sound any better than the Griffins AND the Sennheiser doesn't come with a carrying case. This is a very bad omission because the rubber pieces fall off the earbud so easily. After having one fall off (but, luckily, I found it) I started putting them in a plastic baggy. I would definitely not recommend these Sennheiser, instead get the Griffins. Good luck, Bob

Comment:
These are the first bud headphones I ever bought. They were to replace the oh-so-crappy-sounding default iPod headphones. I bought 'em from Tiger Direct (big mistake) and they have a no returns policy short of the items being defective. After screwing around with the rubber parts that cover the headphones and go into your ear, I finally got the hang of them. The problem is, after 3-6 months some of the wire covering got a hole in it. Not sure how, because I'm pretty careful. But within a few weeks of that, the headphones were hanging by the actual electric wire on the inside and predictably stopped working. So the sound on these things is great. The problem is you'll be back on Amazon looking for replacements within 6 months.

Comment:
I purchased these to use on a plane trip while I was waiting for my Bose Quiet Comfort 3 headphones to be replaced. So, I admit I was spoiled. But these were still a bit disappointing. First and foremost, the buds weren't a good fit on my ear. Fit is way under-appreciated for its impact on whether or not you like or even can use earphone buds. If the fit is fine you don't notice it. But if it doesn't fit, it doesn't matter how good the electronics are; you can't appreciate it. These came with three buds, and the fit was mediocre for me. That meant that there was not very much, if any, noise cancelling, and I couldn't appreciate the music much. For those moments when they were snug, they weren't bad. The reality is that if you want real noise cancelling, you've got to pay for it, and these earphones don't do it. If you want to get noise cancelling buds, get the kind that expand in your ear, guaranteeing fit. If you need, as I did, a quick substitute, these are okay. And if the buds fit, they'll do fine. If not, it's a relatively low cost loss.

The left ear buds stopped working completely. Returning it to Amazon for a refund. Not recommending to my worst enemies.

If you care how your music sounds, I recommend choosing different headphones. I had been using a $20 pair Phillips earbuds. Decided it was time to upgrade a bit, but these sound awful, I will never use them and J&R Music will NOT accept them for a return. There are two basic problems: (1) the sound is flat at the lows and mids and without depth; (2) they distort easily. I just don't get how these are as popular as they seem to be. The only plus is that they are light weight, but if it does not sound good, what's the point.

Comment:
I'm very fond of Sennheiser headphones and have had a set of the "over" the ears type for some time. I do prefer the ear buds, when they fit well they isolate you a from the world a bit more, which can be good (or bad) depending. If you are on an airplane, these are great. What I don't like is moving with theses. The cord length is asymetrical so that the length to the left earbud is 53 inches, and 60 inches to the right. Some people like this but on the two occasions I tried to do my "walk" I found this not to work for me and headed back home to swap. I just found them to pull out of my left ear when on the move.

There was absolutely no bass whatsoever,, and I tried it on a partable Walkman CD player with a radio, a Mini Disc recorder an iPod and my home stereo, as well as even in my TV set, and they all just sounded bad. I will say they were very comfortable though, so if you don't care if there is no bass and the sound is kind of tinny, they are fine.

Have no complaints about the quality of the sound delivered from my iPod. However, I do not understand the use of two different length wires to the ears. The longer one wants to kink up under your chin if you have the wires deployed down your chest instead of your back. Kind of annoying. But the sound is definitely an improvement over the iPods original equipment, and the sound isolation ear-buds do help filter out the background conversations of my socio-pathic office co-workers. That's added a few years to their collective lives.

Header: I *wanted* to like them, I swear...., August 18, 2010
Comment:
Before listening to these earphones even once, I plugged them into my iPod and ran them on "shuffle" for three days straight, in an effort to break them in (I don't know if this whole "breaking in" thing is real or a myth, but I gave it a shot). After 72 hours of break-in time, I started off by listening to some instrumental music (Steve Reich and Vangelis), which both sounded fine. But then I listened to Miles Davis's "'Round Midnight" and had to crank up the volume to hear Paul Chambers's bass (at less than half the iPod's volume, the bass disappeared entirely). And this is my primary problem with the earphones: I need to crank up the volume on my iPod to hear the quieter details of some music, but this means the overtones are louder than I'd like (after cranking it up for this song, it felt like Davis was blaring his trumpet right into my ears). I have pretty good hearing (of the "pin dropping in another room" variety) and I don't want to wreck it now with a pair of earphones that need to be piercingly loud. I tried different "EQ" settings on my iPod, but of course they're so elementary that I didn't find one that gave me the balance I wanted. On the other end of the spectrum, listening to the Beastie Boys as my bass-reponse test was also a disappointment. One of their bass-heavy songs, "B-Boy Bouillabaisse" (in particular the sub-songs "Hello Brooklyn" and "A.W.O.L."), sounded very light on the bass. I realize no pair of earphones (in a reasonable price range, anyway) is going to provide a truly thumping bass sound, but these do not do the Beasties justice. My general problem with these earphones is that they make the music I listen to sound very "bright" (not tinny, exactly, but everything from jazz to classic rock to trip-hop sounds shiny, like the edge has been taken off the music--if that makes any sense). I know audiophiles across the board hate the earphones that come standard with the iPod. But after some trial and error I find that I personally prefer them to the two other earphones I have tried (these, and a pair of Sony earphones I had similar problems with). So I guess my question is this: What's wrong with me? Why do I prefer the generally acknowledged crappy iPod earphones (which may not be the best quality, but which don't mask the subtler sounds in my music behind a general brightness of tone, and *definitely* don't need to be cranked up to an unhealthy volume) to these so-called hi-fidelity earphones? Has anyone else experienced this frustration, and can you recommend some specific earphones that have solved this problem for you? Or is it just me?

Header: Great Noise-Reducers, Good Sound Quality, BUT hygienically BAD!!, April 28, 2010
Comment:
I was so in love with these headphones. Noisy hormonal teenagers on the bus? These babies will zap 'em out. The earthquake rumble of a subway got you flinched? Yes, these will overtake that. However, the way that it does this is, from my amateur perspective, very unhygienic!! If you have ever had earplugs you will now what I mean. Earplugs get mucky from extended use if you stick them all the way in your ear (though I know that some people don't). These earphones work just like earplugs, except you do not need to mold them to make them ultra-slim to fit them in your ear, they are just designed that way. Anyway, you can imagine how icky they get. Maybe I should blame myself for choosing the small(est) ear-cap (there is also a medium and large) but that was how they best fit in my ear: snug and all that good stuff. So, I had a great experience from the moment I defeated the non-hassle-free packaging. Really, I was able to put my SansaClip on Level One volume while in my fairly quiet room (out of like, 20 levels!). I never had to go over a third of my volume's setting. It was great! Besides zoning out the rest of the world, the music came out good, too. I heard some undertones which I had never heard before. But really just not so much different than if I had any other old pair of headphones on a very high volume-setting. Well, I'm returning these headphones because I believe they may be to blame for my ear infection. I wasn't very careful with them (went to bed with them, threw them in bag,etc.,), and I may be especially prone to ear-infections...so this is just a warning. Also, people have been superstitious about earphones for years now, but I have recently joined the crowd. I don't want to go deaf by choice. I don't know what to do for headphones now. The Boses are wayyyyy expensive. I want noise-reducing ones!!! These were almost perfect.

Comment:
The Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds should never be confused with the reputation for excellence in quality that has been long associated with the full blown line of headphones that Sennheiser manufactures. Good treble response but the bass response is tricky to connect with. The earbuds need to be positioned in your ear in a particular way to get the best response. The sound needs to bounce off the walls of the ear canal. Because of the need to fidgit around with positioning the earbuds to get the most desirable output, I rate this item with 4 out of 5 stars.

Header: CX300's are good.  Had Shure e2c's, April 21, 2010
Comment:
I usually do not write reviews but I was really skeptical when buying these, esp for $25. I read a lot online about fake Sennheiser CX300's these are legit, as long as they are fulfilled by Amazon. I own a pair of Shure e2c's (got them for around $60) I've had them for about 2 years and the wiring on one side of the cords had split open. I looked to buy new earbuds and read a ton of reviews. I really wanted to get the UE super.fi 3 but decided against $100 ear buds and bought these instead after reading a lot of good reviews on it. They are great so far, good mids/highs/lows. The e2c's are a little crisper in sound, but these really arent in that price range. I'm sure the negative reviews are from fake CX300's because these earbuds for $25 are great! My only gripes about these are that I liked how the e2c's fit over the ear for a more secure feel, maybe I'm just use to them, at 1st the e2c's felt weird. Another issue is the wiring is thin compared to the e2c's and seems like they will wear out with heavy use in a year.

The cord is a little too short. And the headphones are attached together at a weird point so that one ear has a lot more cord than the other. The buds aren't extremely comfortable but it does come with three size options so they should fit in all ears. The sound is really good for the price and the noise canceling is slightly better than skull candy headphones of the same price.

Comment:
For what these cost, I expected a whole lot more. Not only did they shock my ears with static discharges on the treadmill unless I was grounded, but after very limited use, the right earbud went out completely! Thought I was stepping up from a pair of old Griffin Tunebuds that are still functioning at half the price! Could not have been more wrong. Total the "1" and "2" reviews for this product and you can see you're rolling the dice if you purchase. I suspect the "3-5" reviewers have probably had their buds go bad by now.

Comment:
I was first contented with this product, not happy but happy enough. Quality sound was good. Not so good: length of the cord towards the earbuds is not the same, and this asymmetry is a little unconvenient. Then after about a month of regular use, the right side was not working anymore. Too bad. It was my first experience with Sennheiser products, and likely the last.

When I received my headphones i thought someone had played a practicle joke on me. The leads were different lengths, causing the weight of the leads to be supported by one earpeice. I found this MOST unsatisfactory. I called J&R and complained. They told me that was how headphones were made now. Then, one earphone stopped working. I called J&R again.They allowed me to pick a different style for free. Happy ending.

Header: Worst Earphones to buy, December 3, 2009
Comment:
These headphones almost give me headaches as the completely block the ear canal, but thats of no use to block noise due to poor quality plugs, plus the sound is as if there is no bass in this world.Too much treble is deifnately bad for ur ears and head. I never expected this kind of product from senheisser knowing its reputation in the market, this product is highly just not what it says to deliver I suppose all these positive comments on this product are by themself. its better to stick to apple standard earphones than buying this. The wire is thin, the plastic is cheap, quality is poor, even the mesh kind of thing between also came off in few days and trust me i do not manhandle my stuff, i am still carrying my apple earphones since last 2 and half year and they are still in use as these headphones are of no use to me.

Comment:
Pros : Noise isolation, Stylish, Lightweight, Good Bass, Compact, Good Value, Great Sound Primary use : Personal I am very picky on sounds and own many headphones. This is great earphone for the price. I compared it with Sennheiser CX300B and hands down this Skullcandy Ink'D has way more low end (bass) than sennheisers. It feels like you are next to subwoofers. Noise isolation is excellent. The only area sennheiser won is in crisp clarity but not by much. Skullcandy sounds little metallic but other than that it's wonderful... I'm keeping it for bass and quality sound. Oh yeah, in my lowest volume of laptop, it's very loud... these are very efficient...

Header: Pretty Good With Treble Booster EQ Setting, November 20, 2009
Comment:
I like these okay. Think I paid around 10 bucks for these. With that being said, I feel I've gotten my money's worth, but I do have a couple complaints. I've paid 10 dollars for ear buds in the past that I've liked more. 1. On my iPod, these only sound clear with the EQ set to Treble Booster. If not set to treble booster, the bass with sound really bad, no matter the volume. 2. The cord length is a tad too short. Another 6 inches to a foot would have been great. 3. The ergonomic design of the cord still bothers me. I've gotten used to wearing the chord behind my head, which is fine when I'm at the gym, but when I'm at home I like to have the chord in front of me.

They are incredibly comfortable and I can pretty much wear them indefinitely. These are perfect for what I bought them as: an upgrade to the uncomfortable ipod earbuds. They meet and exceed this goal.

Header: Will Look For Something Else When These Break, November 1, 2009
Comment:
Decided that the average 10-month life of my Bose earbuds was too expensive although I otherwise liked them so I decided to try these based on my son's satisfaction with Sennheiser's collapsible headphone product. I do like the Sennheiser headphones I bought but I do not like the earbuds. They are uncomfortable and do not sit reliably in the ear, unlike the Bose, and the little black ear inserts pop off too easily. In this case, the monetary savings is not worth it. I will definitely not get another pair of these although I might keep looking around before returning to the Bose. Also, a feature that I don't like but which others might actually prefer is the sound-blocking. They actually block sound pretty well except that I am usually doing things while listening to my iPod which involve wanting to be able to hear what is going on around me. The Bose buds did a good job of delivering nice sound without making you sonically oblivious to the rest of the world.

Header: Mediocre sound and horrible cord. Worst earbuds ever., October 29, 2009
Comment:
The sound quality was average compared to other earbuds I've used (Lenntek Sonix). However, the asymmetrical cord made using these for any activity an exercise in frustration. The left side of the cord is shorter than the right so, I'm forced to carry my mp3 player on my left side. Secondly, any arm movement leads to the oddly balanced cord getting caught and I rip out the ear bud accidentally. This happened numerous times but not with any other normal earbuds. I threw these away out of frustration (which I have never done before). Unless you're going to use them while totally inactive, I suggest getting pair of earbuds with a normal cord. These were uncomfortable and worse.

Header: Good and bad - a runner's perspective, October 26, 2009
Comment:
Got these to replace a pair that was dying. I listen mainly to audiobooks, mostly while running. Pro - Sound is good Bad - They fit snugly in the ear canal - rather than outer ear - so they will drown out other sound. Not ideal for runners who still want to be able to hear the environment. When running while wearing them, they reflect a constant swish-swish-swish sound which is extremely irritating. I'm not sure how exactly the phones are affected this way, but I will not be able to use these for running. Bottom line: They're fine for listening while stationary or walking, but if you're planning to use these while really moving, I'd get a pair that sits in the outer ear (i.e., standard ipod like headphones).

Header: Warrantee Coverage, October 25, 2009
Comment:
The left ear bud stopped working. Sennheiser has a two year warantee. I mailed the headphones to Sennheiser and within a month, I got them back. Repaired? That's a matter of opinion. I guess you could call it repaired. The plug into the MP3 player was replaced with a very large, clumsy-looking plug. Okay, I can get over that. What is unacceptable is the 8-1/2" length of cord to the left ear while the right ear cord is twice that length. Not only does it look stupid with a big loop of cord sticking out and getting caught on everything, but it is very uncomfortable to wear now. My solution was to wrap the right cord up with black electric tape at the same length as the left one. Why Sennheiser didn't just send me a new pair is beyond my understanding especially when Amazon sells these for less than $20.

Header: Not what I expected, October 23, 2009
Comment:
I read the reviews and took the bait at under $20. Wow, what a disappointment. Let's start with the sound quality: it is worse that the stock Blackberry headphones that I replaced it with! Treble is tinny and base is non-existent. I was fatigued from using them after only 10 minutes. Positioning them in the ear is critical and think I did get them where they needed to be. The Apple headphones that seem to be the reference for the CX300 must be horrible. Those of you with audiophile tendencies like me should stay away from this set. Now for the cord. It's too noisy (unless you are completely motionless), too short and the asymmetrical design causes the headset to pull awkwardly when you turn your head (especially given the short cord which takes out any slack). I read others reviews of these issues and thought the negative ones were being overly critical given how many positive comments there were. The negatives were right! Again, none of these issues existed with the Blackberries. Even the wire gauge was as thin as the Blackberries. If you are rough on headphones then these won't last for you. I need to point out that I have an excellent over the ear set of wireless headphones for my home system from Sennheiser that are excellent so I was expecting something good to arrive in the package especially given the high user ratings. For me, I wouldn't use the CX300 even if they were free. I'm still in shock that the Blackberries are better!

First of all, I just want to say that I did purchase these because they were on a really good deal and wanted some spare buds for work. The only problem with this product was that the smallest earbud cover was not big enough to fit my ear canal. The fit was really uncomfortable once I wedged it into my ear. The sound quality on the other hand was pretty amazing. I am just one of those people that do not have an ear canal that accepts ear buds, I think that I am part alien...

Comment:
I wanted cheap headphones that don't hurt and don't fall out during a workout. I don't like the different length headphones that sennheiser likes to use. Whenever I turn my head, they tug to one side or another. After playing with the headphone rubber, I found the largest one to fit my ear and not come out. The sound quality is good for cheap phones. I don't hear anything else when I wear them, which is good because the gym plays music which I don't always like. I also have shure's cheap ones, the e2c. The biggest difference to me is the ease of putting in the shure, and the steadiness once they are in. I think the design that wraps around the ear helps. The big question, would I buy them again. Probably not. I like and will continue to use them, but are too much trouble to put in my ear, and feel like they'll come out whenever I move my head.

Comment:
I recently left my earbuds on an airplane. I replaced them with the lower cost Senheiser CX-300. Boy, was I disappointed, and I wish I had saved the price of the SC-300's and applied it to a better pair. However, I have adjusted my equalizer on the iPhone so I can use them, but they are far from Hi-Fi. Previously I had a pair of Etymotic Research ER6i buds, and they were great. Note that they cost considerably more than the Senheisers. The Ety's not only gave great sound (get a good seal in the ear for bass), but they were much more sound isolating. I had to run the sound loud on the Senheisers on a flight, because they give very little sound isolation. Save up your pennies and get the ety's.

These headphones are mediocre. Before I write down what I don't like in it I'd like to note that I also own Sennheiser HD580 and Koss PortaPro headphones, so I'm comparing these CX300 to them. well, to be honest it has nothing common with HD580 except badge. even PortaPros, that have cut down highs sound lot richier than these. so, what I dislike: 1. sound is muddy. highs are missing, bass and mids are blended 2. hard to insert into ears. you need to insert these really deep. kinda hurts 3. as noted by others, cable is physically noisy. when it bounces you really hear it and it is really annoyng. I think these are overrated. I bought it straight from amazon and I did checked, they ar not fake. to be honest, Koss PortaPro's are lot better for 10$ more. I just needed in-ear headphones to watch movies on Cowon A2 and don't brake them when I get sleep :) so these kinda work for what I bought them. listening music in these? - no way

I've been buying Sennheiser products for about 13 years and have never been disappointed. Unfortunately, i can't say this any more after having used the CX300-B. The sound quality is pathetic: tinny verging on scratchy, weak weak bass, and very narrow range. I've compared the sound to a 15.99 sony set and this is far inferior. As an aside, cord length will be an issue if you like a little distance between you and your laptop/player. I realize these are cheaper than buds selling in the 70$ + range, but even at this price, it's extremely disappointing. I'm surprise Senn put their name on this. Bump up your budget and go with a set of v-moda or a higher range (Senn bud if there is one).

Comment:
I have to say I've been using Sennheiser products for years with no complaints, but these earbuds are a waste of money. Quite simply, the sound is only a very modest amount better than the free iPod ones and simply not worth the cost of the upgrade. More importantly... any slight touch on the wire from ear to iPod gives such a noise it renders them unusable in any situation other than sitting still. Annoyingly they were sealed in a plastic container that took me 20 minutes of dangerous work with a knife to open. How ridiculous. I would recommend this product is avoided by everyone. The seller was excellent though. The product was shipped quickly and effectively and the good were perfect.

Ordered two of these Earbuds based on recommendations here. Within 2 weeks of very gentle, infrequent use the right channel quit working on both pair of buds. Obviously defective, but I never heard back from Amazon re: my issues. I unfortunately didn't save the packaging but would like to have had my problems acknowledged. Anyway very disappointing all round, out 40 bucks and girlfriend and I have to go buy new buds, I hope all these company's manufacturing and selling junk go out of biz...

Header: Not bad for the price, January 28, 2009
Comment:
For the average listener, you can certainly do worse than the CX300s. They sound good for a ~$30 pair of earbuds (they were only $20 when I ordered a month ago) and are fairly comfortable. They also do an adequate job of blocking out the noise from the loudmouth sitting next to you. Do they sound as good as a set of 'phones costing a couple hundreds bucks? Do they block background noise so well that it's like sitting in a soundproof room? Of course not, but for everyday listening with moderate background noise, these work just fine. My only complaint *so far* is the stupid asymmetrical cord. What a PITA. The only benefit I can think of regarding this "feature" is it makes it easy to tell the L from the R at a glance. Other than that, it sucks. Sennheiser, please make the L and R cords equal length!

Comment:
Decent headphones, particularly for the money. Plenty of bass without it being over powered. I did need to crank the mids up and the treble down though, they do start out a bit tinny. Comfortable so far, be interesting to see how they hold up on a transatlantic flight, the reason I'm trying the in the ear kind. The biggest complaint, wow is the packaging crap. Welded plastic that was welded all the way to the case edge so you can't just trim off the seams. I had to start by stabbing a hole in the front and cutting out from that. Can we really not do better for packaging?

The quality of the bass is super. When u put it, u will travel in an other world cause the sound is very pure and you can't hear the surrounding! Small problem that when u put it U don't hear anything else, so it's a little bit dangerous to use it when u are walking in streets cause u won't hear the traffic at all. second prob. u won't hear evan your voice so it's difficult to sing when u put it! :P

If you can get the buggers to stay in your ear for the duration of a song, please e-mail me and let me know how they sound. JK - they stayed put for a minute and the sound is, well - "ain't all that". As a non-bonus, they have no case so you can spend your spare time chasing the little ear pieces around the room and digging for them under your couch assuming you enjoy these things..and good luck with that. And speaking of the ear pieces..did I mention they are GREAT at FALLING OUT (yes I did in the first sentence), regardless of the size you pick. If you're into ear-bud drop-outs then these are for you! These babies are way behind the graduation curve. But WAIT! ISLE NO. 2! COME ON DOWN! There's more! The Sennheiser CX 300 cords are created so one is MUCH shorter than the other (like maybe for aliens with an ear on their forehead?). It amazes me just how this particular technological "epiphany" ("Breakthrough") of these "amazing" one-side shorter cords actually made it through to production for a few companies, but somehow, it did. Maybe they were on the assembly line long after somebody with a brain yelled "STOP!" Here's a TIP: For under $15 with a pretty fine sound, just grab those Griffin Ear Thumps and get that cool case too.

Header: Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)  - functionally adequate, December 29, 2008
Comment:
Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) are ordinary and adequate. I was going to comment that as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for but since the price dropped about $10 since I bought it a month ago, I have may have gotten even less than I paid for. But I'll consider it my contribution towards the pre-Christmas economic health of our consumer market unless, of course, if Amazon.com is willing to refund me the difference. ;) They are worth $20, primarily because one can hardly buy any headphones for less.

If I would have paid more for these I would probably be disappointed for all the reasons other people have stated... But these are definitely a step up from what I had. The sound is great, they fit well and I got them at a great price -- I'm happy. IF my cat happens to get a hold of them (b/c they don't come with a case)I won't totally be heartbroken. UPDATE - 12/3/07 - I'm returning these earphones. They SUCK! In my opinion anyway. I just ordered the Shure E3c!

I have small ears (I'm an adult, 140 lbs). Even with the smallest rubber nibs, these are difficult to get in. This is a personal concern, of course, but a warning for those of you who have smaller ears. They are not comfortable to get in. I have to push very hard, and because the rounded shape of the opposite end, you don't know if you are pushing the right way. The sound is great IF you can get them to fit, but I found the sony MD51s to fit my small ears better.

These headphones literally plug into your ear. They sound great and block a lot of external noise, but every time you bump the wire it makes a loud hollow bump in the earpiece. Not good for exercising. Also you can hear yourself breathe loudly through your nose. So my coworkers see me being very still and breathing through my mouth. The asymmetrical cord length works but means you have to reverse L-R to get the short side on the right if that's what you need (the way my desk is, i require my MP3 player at my right elbow, also my laptop headphone plug is on that side. Not too big of a deal unless you are relying on stereo positioning. I like these, but I considered returning them - I destroyed the plastic packaging through trying to open it so I decided to just keep them and use them at work.

These earphones are a great price and have a great mid - high range however, the low or (bass) is really poor. You have to really turn up the volume and EQ (power) to get some bass. The ear piece is designed too short and they don't want to stay in your ears very well.If Sennheiser could change these things and keep the price the same around $35.00 and market them by challenging people to compare they with their more expensive competitors they would sell a lot of them! I should also mention that they came almost overnight with regular shipping!

I own a pair of HD-595 and purchased a pair of HD-497 as a gift for my brother. They are excillent for the prices. I did not hesitate to place the order after briefly reading the reviews. Well, disapointed. Too much highs, bass has no depth. Try removing the rubber cover, they sound cheaply. The worst thing is the mids, badly distorted. Changing the rubber cover may help a little bit with the bass, depending on your ears but mids can not be corrected. I was afraid of the fake products, so I purchased them directly from Amazon. I trusted Senn so much that I just tossed away the box and all the papers. Now I'm just wondering if I can return these.

Bought these a few months ago to add on another unit. I also use Sony 51's which I like alot and have served well for over a year now. The Sennheisers sound excellent. The cord tangles easy and there is a little rub noise when the cable is moved but I hardly notice it. Overall, I like these ALOT. The problem? I lost one of the little rubber tips. I emailed Sennheiser because I was unable to locate replacements. All they can sell me is the tips by the bag, 10 pieces per bag for $18! I guess I would probably need to add who knows what for shipping and maybe tax. Outrageous! I need one, not an expensive bag of ten! I have lost only one tip in almost two years of using this style earphones. I am supposed to spend half of what these cost to get a simple rubber tip replaced? I would think Sennheiser would be ashamed of this idea. They have lost a customer over what is probably a fifteen cent piece of rubber.

First of all wtf i ordered a Sennheiser cx 300B but got the regular cx 300 no B with it. Did this happen to anyone else??? Great ear phones. You gotta have the right size earbuds on to fit your ear perfectly for maximum bass. I used my old sony 71 style ear buds and put them on the Sennheiser 300(B). I could hear my notes in my songs than the Sony's 71 series with better quality. Also you need good quality songs to have good quality sound. The only problem is that its kinda of short from my pant's pocket to my ears, btw i'm already short, think of what a tall person has to go through. All in all i'm am very pleased because the Sony's 71 material quality was a F-, I guess for $54.99 its good if you have the money to spend.

Comment:
I was very excited to buy this headset for my workout sessions. However, I was very disappointed with the lackluster performance. The sound was thin and tinny. Actually, the plain white Apple earbuds sound better! I would say the only thing I liked about these are the comfort. Not sure what all the great reviews are about but perhaps I'm a little more picky than most. For instance, I also generally dislike Bose but a lot of people rave about that garbage. Usually I'm a huge fan of Sennheiser, but I, and a lot of audiophiles, feel they are damaging their reputation with these cheap buds. Too be sure, I understand the engineering challenges of trying to produce headphone quality out of earbuds, but until a product hits the market that achieves that standard, I'm sticking with the plain old Apple freebies!

They never mention it in the product description, but these are completely worthless if you have a small ear canal. Not only do they constantly fall out, but the sound quality - specifically, the bass response - depends upon the fit, so no fit equals awful, tinny sound. Also, the asymmetrical cord is completely lame. I've owned various Sennheiser headphones over the year, these are the first disappointment, but a big one.

Just received these airbuds today based on all the positive reviews. All I am trying to find is a unobstrusive set of earplugs for at the gym....some noise canceling but mostly that stay in your ear most of the time. These sound good enough BUT....it is so weird. The right plug wire is literally 3x (probably like 12 inches) the length of the left plug wire. So, the apex where the to wires come together are not centered thus forcing gravity to pull the left plug out of my ear. I have had the Shure's before but the price was so good on these. They must be a manufacturing reject and I would NOT RECOMMEND THESE.

After reading all the great reviews of these headphones, I thought that I couldn't go wrong. But, I was mistaken. These headphones sound very tinny, and have almost no bass. My apple headphones that came with my iphone are much much better, which was a surprise. The sound isolation is decent, but the sound quality is poor. But, that is what you get for $20. If you are looking for better headphones than apple includes, look elsewhere! These are cheaper, in every regard. The cable is very flimsy and thin. The whole package feels cheap, which it is. I feel like the cheap sony headphones you can buy at Target for $15 are better than these.

Header: Stupendous clarity with Pumping Bass, March 11, 2008
Comment:
Let me start off with the bass driven technology these buds work on. If your the kind of person who likes that punch in a music, look no further. these are so damn good in doing just that. Having said that i know some of you might think that this bass could actually drown the song and the highs, but trust me these are engineered to deleiver the perfect balance of the Lows,mid ranges and the clear highs. These sometimes give you the feeling that ur not having ne thing in ur ears and are listning through ur speakers, such is the comfort in plugging these into ur ears, it gives u a feeling of surround sound (of course ur Kbps of ur song shud be eqaully gud). Decent isolation, enough to provide almost Total isolation when the music is playing and a OK isolation when just plugged in with no music playing.The silicon plugs stay firm on the drivers and dont pop out, even if u get the buds pulled out violently from ur ears.buds fit snugly in ur ear and dont fall off,perfect for gym. Not so much for jogging and running though, cause u can hear noises in ur plugs when the wire rub against the clothes or neck, something thats very common with in ear headphones. I heard the Bose Tripor IE, and then these beauties, the CX300 had more punch and crisp bass, stayed firm in the ears, dont go all the way into ur ears which can be slightly uncomfortable at times and better ambience in the music that came out. I must tell u that the CX300 initially is not upto its full gain when plugged in for the first couple of songs, let it warm up (get the drivers juiced up) and then 10 minutes into listening , it'll hit u as to how gud these buds are. this is only for the first time u take it out of the retail packaging, it then is always ready to get u pumping everytime u plug it in. All said, i've enjoyed every song i ve heard out of these. a great buy.

Comment:
After much anticipation, due to all the positive reviews, I finally got my pair of cx-300. The equipment I used with was an iPod nano 3rd gen, which is what I suspect the typical use most people would have for these buds. I did try it against various other equipments that people would probably use with this pair of buds, such as portable cd player (sony antique!), laptops, desktop computer, and for reference with a decent hifi hooked up to headphone amp (meridian 508.24 to an old amp). I have heard professional studio monitors such as Sennheiser HD650 and Grado RS-1, but I am not going to use those for comparison. They just let me know what is possible. As soon as I put these on, there's an overwhelming amount of bass. Granted, the bass isn't smudged, but it sounds like the frequency response was all bass and not much else. Starting from the mid bass range there's an explosive increase in the response, no matter what I listened to (not track related). I had to go straight into equalizer to tune it down as it got to be rather intolerable. I did try to listen with equalizer turned off, and the following holds true even after the bass got reduced: the mid range is fairly lacking. It sounds like one of those cheap speakers built to impress: juice up the bass and kick up the treble, and people will be impressed (and people do). The difference is that there's not as much glaring distortion in the high, it's not as ear piercingly forward (only the extreme high is pronounced, the rest of the treble band is actually a bit laid back. in other words, you get a lot of those hissing frequencies but subdued vocal ranges), and the bass is tighter. In these the CX is remarkable. However, to me it's equally unpleasant and listening fatigue will inevitably result in a short amount of time. In short: the bass is overwhelming, there's a dip in the mid to high range, and the high treble is pronounced. Hmm.. That sounds rather generic and unsatisfying. Where's the amazing audiophile clarity that I keep on reading about? In the midst of the elevated treble and pounding bass, the details are sorely lacking. Yes, it is better than the iPod headphones, which are truly aweful, and frankly not that hard to surpass. Yet to me this headphone is really only marginally better than some of the other cheaper/free buds, including its Creative twin and a free bud that came with my sansa player. I read plenty reviews/articles about how CX300 compares well with those much more expensive In-Ear-Monitors (from Shure, Etymotic, and Ultimate Ears, etc.) and even beating them. If true, those IEMs must really suck (which I doubt), or this CX's price became the reason for the hype. Other notes: The stock buds fit me fine and resulted in good seal/noise isolation and strong bass. It's not uncomfortable to wear. The build quality seemed average, thin and slightly rigid cables (can tangle and won't stretch or hang as well as the softer higher quality cables) that's just long enough. No gold plating on the contacts but that's probably not going to matter. The connector is L shaped, for those who care. Cables are asymmetric, which is useful for hanging the buds around your neck when you take them out (you wear it differently than conventional symmetrical wires, with one wire behind your neck rather than hanging in front of it). The headphone is decent, but you kinda get what you paid for, or I rather think you should expect more for your money. Those other dedicated IEM models may very well be worth the extra money (whose prices came down A LOT, while CX300's went up, making CX300 far less of a value that generated the initial buzz). If tons of bass is your cup of tea, then this does deliver! However, it would be a stretch to rate these as in-ear-monitors. There's hardly anything hi-fidelity or accurate about it, and one must be careful not to start hearing emperor's new clothes.

Comment:
The buds fit well and do block out noise. However, it seems that some of the blocking is due to a persistent buzz (or hum) in the background. I didn't use the earbuds for quite some time so too late to return. I tried them on a desktop, laptop and MP3 player. The least buzz was with the MP3 on a plane. Would not buy again, but maybe I just got a lemon. They come with different size earbuds so you get a good fit.

This was my first I considered performance earbuds, they definitely lived up to their reputation. The sound quality was excellent. I hated the "brushing" noise, I noticed after the split point from the wire, the right side didn't have this problem, but it still remained on the left side. I am not a big fan of the asymmetrice design of the wire but I will just have to get used to it. Aside from these two points I love them and I strongly recommend them.

I'm shocked by the sound that comes from these. They are not up to Sennheiser's usual standards. Just bought these along with several other brands of earbuds plus several headphones and these were the worst of the bunch, by far. The Sennheiser PX100 and PX200 headphones were of good quality for their price range. To me these are an aberration in the Sennheiser line. I'm not ready to recommend other earbuds but try something else.

You cannot beat the price for a closed ear headphone. the thing that I did not expect out of this (and presumably all closed ear headphones) is that I can hear myself. I hear my breathing(I breath lightly, I am not a wheezing ex-smoker). Sometimes I think I can hear my heart beat. All of this adds to more background sound so I have to turn up the volume. Other than my own breathing, these headphones are great. They have the best bass response of any earbud I've used. These are my first in-ear headphones so I cannot compare, but for the price they beat any earbud I've used.

Comment:
I saw many positive reviews for these headphones, so I was expecting some relatively good headphones, but I was WRONG. First off, the cord for the right headphone is 14 inches longer than the left, which is about 14 inches long. So basically, you end up with a bunch of wire from the right headphone curling up right below your neck. That sucks. It's beyond me why you would ever want a right headphone to be more than 4 times longer than the left. Next, when I received my headphones the right headphone was NOTICEABLY quieter than the left. It was insanely distracting, and I'm printing the papers to return these as I write this. I would NOT recommend buying these headphones to ANYONE.

The sound quality of these earbuds is ok on my ipod (which i was using these for) but i found i had to readjust the equalizer for different types of songs, which i never had to do with the regular Apple earbuds, and these were a replacement for those. i thought i'd try a different brand, but i ended up going with Apple instead. Plus the little rubber caps that actually fit into your ear simply pop right off very easily - something to look out for when using these, which is why they give you an extra pair when you buy these. But i DID NOT like that feature at all. i don't want any removable parts that were too easy to lose!

I was also told by someone that these passive ear-plug type earphones are better at blocking noise than active noise-cancelling headphones. I disagree.

Header: The Best Earbud Speakers I Have Ever Heard, February 27, 2010
Comment:
Sennheiser CX 300 black B Verses Klipsch Image S2 Comfort-Fit Noise-Isolating Earphones First I ordered the Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black). I chose a slow mode of delivery, which is always a mistake, only if you're not patient, like me. It ended up that I received the Klipsch headphones first since I paid for a faster shipping method. My setup is a Nokia 5530 phone which has an sd memory card inside where is the place the music files end up, normally when I burn a CD into a file. I use the best quality below lossless since lossless would eat up to much space. I normally burn a CD and then the phone software transfers the music files over. I then have a little Nokia blue tooth control that I clip on my shirt. With that little device I can connect to the phone through Bluetooth. I can fast forward, fast reverse, go back a song, go forward a song, pause it, change the volume up and down and I can do this both with a sound file like mp3 or a movie in mp4. For instance I have Batman Begins and the Devil's Advocate and I can do all this without going near the phone. I believe it is more than a phone. I believe it is a phone plus PDA. You can play on the internet with your wireless router through the house. Now back to the headphones. The best part of the Bluetooth Nokia Device is that I can plug any mini plug headphone into it that I want. I had a Sony headphone sitting around that I decided to try first. The sound quality was not very good. It was dull and lifeless. Then I tried the Klipsch the most expensive of the bunch. Their claim to fame is their clarity of sound and they claim their so comfortable that you can't even feel them in your ears. First I would like to address the sound quality. It's not bad. I would say ten times better than the Sony. I hear clarity and accuracy of sound but unfortunately not much else. The bass is lacking completely. There is clarity but there is too much tininess, as for the comfort of the headphones. The Klipsch is good in that respect, but like every earbud headphone it is a chore to get it perfectly right. Klipsh recommends twisting them a little bit inward and then pulling them out a small amount to create a vacuum. That method seems to work well for that headphone, but it doesn't really work well on others. Finally the Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) almost half the price of the Klipsch..I first put them in my ears and they popped out. I tried again and pushed harder with the same result. Finally I went to get the extra ear plugs that Sennheiser provides which were smaller and put the ones that were a step down in size. They stayed in my ears and to me felt just as comfortable as the Klipsch.I tried a variety of music, from classical to popular to some jazz. I was blown away. I had never heard sound like that from an earbud headphone. It was rich and full and just enough bass, not too much and the bass did not sound muddy or unclear. The highs were just as good and there was a richness of sound that I have never hears in earbud headphones. Now I am not saying the Sennheiser CX 300 black can reach the quality of a full sized expensive Pro Unit, but it comes very close. The richness of sound of these headphones is excellent and unsurpassed by similar costing units.

Despite many claims that these earbuds are for use with the iPhone (even in many of the reviews you see here), they DO NOT HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE. This renders them virtually useless for the iPhone. Sure, you can listen to music through them, but what's the point if you can no longer take a call or have any of the other functions of the iPhone requiring a microphone. No products should carry the label "for use with the iPhone" (which is also right on the product packaging)if they are not fully functional for the iPhone! I'll have to give these to my kids who use iPods and keep looking for a reasonably priced set of earbuds...but with the microphone this time!

Sennheiser does not provide any type of protective case for the earbuds or for the 'extra' ear cushions. After cutting and slicing out this product with scissors from the typical nasty sealed plastic packaging, you're stuck with all of these very fragile parts, and with no place to save and protect them when not in use. The earbud wires are incredibly thin and fragile, and I don't believe they will survive everyday use. The only thing impressive about this product is the `Sennheiser' brand name; otherwise I've seen similar 'cheesy' products at the 'dollar' store for far less money!

Comment:
These earbuds create a vacumn tight seal within your ears, this results in hearing yourself chew, or hearing the earbud cord as it rubs against your cheek or clothes. VERY ANNOYING. I imagine that the only way to enjoy these earbuds is to sit very still and not move at all. I can't believe that they user tested this and found this not to be a problem. If you rock out to music, or move around you will hear the revirb (very equivalent to the sounds you hear while underwater in a pool) of your own movements. These revirb sounds are as loud or even louder than the music playing. Swapping out ear plugs lessen the problem but does not eliminate it. Apart from this, the sound quality is only mediocre. I was not particulary blown away or amazed with the sound quality. Just a very mediocre set of earbuds that causes more frustration than anything else. Lame.

I took these headphones outside and walked around with them, and I hear wind, the chord moving around, and your own breathing. I do not recommend these headphones at all unless you plan on using these while sitting at your desk.

Please read my review of the HEAD-DIRECT RE2s for background. I received the Sennheiser CX300-Bs in 5 business days. The thing I noticed immediately when I connected the CX300-Bs to my laptop was a very faint hiss. My wife could not hear it when she tried them. I did not bother to try them on my IPhone. I did a laptop-only comparison against the Sony MDR-EX51LPs, the RE2s, and the CX300-Bs repeatedly and conclude that the CX300-Bs sound thin to me - they have good response to the higher-end but so-so in the middle and not as base-strong as the Sonys. The Sonys have good response to the low end and so-so response to the middle and better response to the high end. I think the RE2s have a balanced response and bring out the middle perfectly as compared to the other two. I actually preferred the Sony's over the CX300-Bs and that was a shocker! My wife liked the CX300-Bs a lot after she compared them against the RE2s on her Zune so she is going to keep them to replace her stock Zune headphones, which she was hitherto happy with. She liked the higher-end response of the CX300-Bs. She has ADD, by the way, so maybe that has something to do with it(smile). Everyone's physiology and tastes are different so choosing the best earbuds for you is a matter of preference I suppose. I'll be letting the children decide which they prefer. Should be interesting. I gave the Sennheiser CX300-Bs a 3 review because I did not like them very much at all but my wife loved them. If she were reviewing them I'm sure she'd score them higher, as others have. For me the RE2s are the best I've tried! I think they have the best balanced-response. If I could give them a 6 score I would! Good Luck! What you like is what's important.

I ordered these as a replacement for the earbuds which came with my Sansa hoping to get an improvement in sound quality. I was very disappointed at first because they had almost no bass. After playing around with them for a few days (and cussing a lot and writing a scathing review) I discovered that I had not inserted them properly in my ears. They should go into the ear canal until a seal is formed, almost like you're trying to seal out water. Then the bass kicks in. The sound quality was much better when properly inserted. Overall a big improvement over the stock Sansa buds. Should be 4 stars, but I can't edit the rating.

For being advertised for their 'bass', these earbuds are a true disappointment. I expected much better from Sennheiser. To get any bass at all, you have to nearly shove the bud into your brain. The high end is so high you can't even hear the music the way it's supposed to sound. And for anyone who is about to say I must just have a hearing problem, I can assure you, my hearing is fine. I will admit I am picky about sound, but the standard headphones I got with my Zune 120 are 1000% better sounding than these things. I was shocked at how many 5-star ratings these buds got (which is why I chose them in the first place). I bought a pair for both me and my husband and both of us put them in (after spending 15 minutes just trying to get into that plastic packaging to get to them) and we both looked at each other and said "are you kidding???" I think I'll look into the Zune premium headphones that are supposed to be very good. If I could have given these Sennheiser buds 0 stars, I would have.

I purchased a pair for my Nano about eight months ago, based on the strong recommendations in the media and on this page. Although I was somewhat disappointed that the improvement over the Ipod stock earbuds was negligible, I chalked up my inability to hear much of a difference to the damage to my ears caused by standing in front of a bass guitar amp (at full volume) for several years... I use my Ipod about 6-8 hours/week while commuting by bus and/or train. The right earphone has failed - fortunately I kept my stock earbuds. They are working fine, so the problem is definitely the CX300-B and not my hearing!

I bought a pair of these earbuds based on the reviews I read here, - big mistake and waste of money - as replacement for Sony MDR-ED21LP. They are constantly falling off, regardless of the foam size tried. Try to squeeze them in and it's like scraping your ear canals with a blunt object. I went back to the Sony - less than half the price of the Sennheiser, more comfortable, stays in your ears and sounds great!

I have over 25 years of experience engineering and design in audio. I've watched the world move to mp3 and when encountering quality systems, heard people say stuff like, "I can't tell the difference". These earphones are for people that can't hear the difference from quality sound. They are so bass heavy that you might as well have your ears filled with glue and call it music. I can't believe that Sennheiser would put out such a bad product. They are easily the worst purchase I have made in audio in several years. If you want better quality for about half the cost, try Aiptek's Fidelity line of earphones.

Be careful of this brand of headphones. I thought the price was a steal at under $15 and it was. It ultimately wound up screwing up my iPod b/c the size of the input was too large and it constantly made my iPod pause for no reason. Also, the headphones died within a few weeks. While Sennhesiers customer support team was great, and informed me they would send me a replacement free of charge, when they noticed they were fake, they could not help me. I strongly suggest you buy Sennheiser headphones direct from Sennheiser, although they are a bit pricier, you know for sure you are getting the real thing and their customer support team is excellent.

Comment:
After reading all the reviews and high praise that these headphones received, and also after some extensive research (being sure not to purchase the counterfeit headphones), I decided that these were the headphones for me (the review stating the proper use of these headphones is what sold me). Boy was I wrong! First off, the rubber that covers the wire feels very cheap and thin. It's not durable and within a couple of uses, will easily start to wear and tear. Not good for functionality (especially if you use these headphones for anything from walking to exercise). Second, the earbuds are not comfortable at all. I tried the smallest earbud covers as I know my ears are small, and couldn't keep them in for long. It was just irritating (not at all like my sony earbuds). These earbuds felt like they were stretching the inside of my ear. Not at all a comfortable feeling. I did manage to get them in deep enough as to hear the sound and not destroy my ear drum at the same time. As for the sound. I'm not a connoisseur of music and sound but these headphones add no life to the music. The sound is bland, boring, and flat which makes the music loud and annoying (I mostly listen to rock, but also a wide range of other genres as well). I've even tried switching the different equalizer's on my MP3 player and it gets no better. The headphones are advertised as to have bass but if that's what they call bass, then they are sadly mistaken. The bass is nothing more than a boost in the low tones of the music. The high tones are way too loud and you can't even hear the midtones. These headphones are very overrated and sound just like a cheap pair of iPod-like headphones. These headphones definitely aren't the ones for me as I like my music to sound as if it's alive and these headphones don't do it. Doesn't mean that these aren't the headphones for you. If you like flat and boring sound, then by all means, these would be perfect for you. Or (for the objective side) if you like your music loud, these are perfect because they can definitely get loud. And if you're wondering if I got a counterfeit pair, well then I guess Amazon is selling counterfeits (not accusing of course, just sarcastically making a point on authenticity of headphones) because that's where I got these from. If you do decide that these are for you, I have a pair that have only been used five times to test sound and would be glad to sell them to anyone who wants because I think, no, I'm sure I've just wasted 45.00 dollars.

Whilst the sound quality is good (as one would expect), there is a fundamental design flaw. One of the earphones has a cable that's a foot longer than the other. That means you will have a loose piece of cord hanging about your neck - permanently. It's rather annoying. There are alternatives on the market...

I just don't like the extra long wire (15 inches) on one side of the earphones. Due to this design, one ear bud keeps popping out. Can't use these at the gym since the extra weight of one side keeps causing them to come out. I can't comment on the sound since I can't keep them in place long enough to listen. Picture is deceiving since it make one side look only one inch longer when in fact mine is about 15 inches longer on one side. Returning ASAP!!

These earbuds are hi-fi with loads of low-end and surprisingly the vol level is quite loud so I can turn the vol down on my iPod to save battery. The length of the cord is too short as I like to store my iPod in my front pocket and this sometimes tugs on my earphones. It sucks that there is no storage case, I am using the old case from my $39 sony earbuds.

I bought these the same time my girlfriend bought her Bose ear-buds. She paid $40 more for hers. What a sucker! I'm talking about me, not her. Do yourself the favor and spend the extra $40. The mids and highs are pretty nice, but the CX300's do not offer a good bass sound. Perhaps the CX300-B's are nicer in that area. Just remember, you get what you pay for.

I wrote a review about 2 years ago saying that the earphone sounds tinny. A year after I wrote the review, the local newspaper had an article about counterfeit earphones and showed two photos of unopened packages of earphones that looked slightly different from each other but both was professionally packaged. One was identified as being a counterfeit. I recall clearly that I had purchased the counterfeit looking package. I purchased it from a marketplace seller NOT Amazon. Now I know why the price was so much cheaper. The seller did give me back a refund for the tinny sound but deducted the shipping cost.

I bought these Senns based on several positive reviews I read. Although the sound they produce is clear and precise, the bass response to me is terrible. They just don't go down as low as the original iPod buds I have, nor as low as some older Creative buds I also have. I've experimented with the ear tips and with the EQ settings of my iPod, but the bass is just NOT THERE. They are much more comfortable to wear than the "flater" style of most other ear buds, but other than that, I'm pretty disappointed in the CX300s for the price.

I used the reviews(all positive) on this page to decide to purchase these earbuds. My Shure E-3's are busted and felt that this technology must be safe with a company as well regarded as Sennheiser. Not the case these buds they are comfortable but that is were the praise stops as far as I am concerned. A test of my favorite music rendered these earbuds unusable for anything but heavily distorted rock and roll. Any music that relies on vocals sound sibilent and thin. Test these out before you commit or just stay away.

I wanted to get something better than the standard earphones for my Ipod. I saw some good reviews and this brand has been known always for great headphones. Bought these and was shocked at the terrible sound quality. Yes, the sound is clean, but TOO clean. The highs are too high leading to tinny and over-brassy sound. Voices have too much hiss. There is virtually no low end bass of any type. Very disappointing.

Even with their sub-$20 price tag, there are better alternatives. Considering the average noise isolation and sound quality, and the highly pronounced chord noise, choose a different pair. For those who claim that the chord sensitivity only exists with imitation CX 300s, mine come from JR, which is a licensed retailer.

Comment:
[update] I've now had FOUR sets in a row and they have ALL had exactly the same problem. Thankfully there is a 2 year warranty and Sennheiser does replace them, but my warranty is almost up and I'm about to send my current set back again! Seriously, don't waste your time. [original review] I had these for about 3 months before the sounds went out in the left earphone. At first I liked them - the sound is good, but the earbuds are too big (even the smallest of the 3 sizes included) and so it's hard to get them to stay in my ears and the cords are tacky (as in sort of sticky) so they tangle extremely easily. I've just sent them back to Sennheiser (at my expense) to hopefully have them fixed as they're still under warranty.

Header: Sennheiser cx-300 earbuds Black, July 5, 2008
Comment:
Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) I rate these an F for function and design and an A for sound quality. The buds are difficult inserting into the ear canal, the left earbud cord is about 15 inches shorter than the right which makes it easy for the left bud to exit the ear frequently and the rubber bud covers falls off the actual bud frequently. All of these are horrible design flaws. The earbud jack wire has a 90 degree turn instead of plugging straight into the iPod jack like the Apple earbuds do. This is an odd and inconvenient design. The material used to coat the earbud wires creates a rubber against rubber sound and is transmitted through the earbuds when walking or moving about. The sound quality is excellent through all frequencies. However I would not buy these again due to their design and will probably go back to the Apple earbuds.

I have other Sennheiser headphones, so that's why I bought another pair, but they didn't work out for me.

These things sound like something you would get as a prize in a Cracker Jack box. This is the first time in years that a product I have purchased from Amazon is so totally different than the reviews describing it. Save your $50 and spend it on earbuds that work.

Okay, I was looking for some earphones that would at least fit my ears a little bit better than what came with my iPod...so that's why I chose to purchase te Senheiser's earbuds...not only that, but they were reviewed in my local paper as having some of the "best sound quality" available for the cost. The sound IS okay, however, occassionally there is static heard if the wires move just the right way, and I think for the price paid (somewhere around $53) I shouldn't hear a trace of static. The biggest disapointment with these earphones is that they did not come with a storage case, and they are not retractable. I take that back, the BIGGEST disappointment with this pair of earphones is that one side is much shorter than the other, and there is no way to adjust them. Stupid design! I would not recommend these earphones.

Based on the reviews, I was really hoping these earbuds would sound good, block out external noise, and fit really well. I was wrong on all counts. They were worthless for wearing while jogging, as they kept moving around inside my ear canal. I even tried the different size rubber tips to try to get them to fit better, but no luck. I found that they sound OK when sitting still, but the audio quality is best only when they're all the way in, touching the eardrum and that was tiring. So I put these in a drawer and went back to my Apple earbuds. The way they fit in the ear is better, and even though they don't sound great, at least they're consistent.

I bought these headphones for $50 dollars but please read this review and don't waste your money. First of all ask yourself why do you need noise cancellation. This is definately because you don't want to hear outside noise when you are travelling and here is the problem with these. These are great sounding ear buds if you are sitting idle but once the wires start to move (e.g. if you are travelling) then you will clearly hear distortion in your ear. Plus you can even hear the wire move around and I swear that you won't be able to wear them for more than five minutes. ( The noise of wire moving nauseated me and made me vomit) Do yourself a favour and don't buy these.If you want noise cancellation go for full size noise cancellation headphones or at least don't buy these ones. They are useless.

I read the reviews and expected something awesome, but was completely dis-satisfied. I did not get a deep base sound using any of the ear adapters, the only real difference was the Treble. But since I like Bass, I'm returning them for a refund. I also switched between the EQ settings on the NANO and could not get a better overall sound from them. The sound difference just wasn't worth the $55 bucks. Also, the wiring is unbelievably cheap, unlike the IPOD cord which is a heavey duty gauge, cut even and hangs down without any effort, these are thin and were all curled up from shipping. Maybe it depnds on the shape of your ears, and the type of player you are using. If you buy them, make sure you get a return policy just incase.

I bought these based on a newspaper review, which tested various headphones. The reviewer found these to be of the best quality and sound for the money. Well the reviewer was wrong. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for these, based on sound criteria. Also, the buds do not fit the ears well with any of the 3 "rubber" adaptors provided. The adaptors are cheaply constructed and prone to pop off (I lost one the first day). As for sound, these make the iPod earbuds sound like Bose headphones. Don't waste your money.
