I bought these headphones solely for the use of listening to music while I play my drum set. These headphones do an excellent job of muting outside sounds. It feels like I am in the band and I can hear the drums in the background of the song while I play it. Sound quality is excellent and they are very comfortable. The cord is long enough that you probably won't need the extension cord recommended by Amazon with your purchase. Everything met or exceeded my expectations when I purchased these headphones. Buyers should take note that I didn't have these headphones very long; I gave 5 stars in durability because they look sturdy and others seem to have found these durable. I have not tested their durability. I gave bass 4 stars because while the headphones will play the music, the people that enjoy shaking a town with the bass on their truck's stereo system might be a little disappointed. Portability is 4 stars because headphones are naturally large and there is no easy way to store them when traveling. These headphones come with a plastic piece to wrap the cord around when not in use. With everything taken into account, these headphones are a high-quality bargain at $25.

These headphones are some of the best headphones I have ever purchase. I wouldn't be what you would call an audiophile but I do like to listen to music. Also I needed something that kept most of the noise out when I was at work. For the 20 dollars or so that I spent on these they go way above and beyond what I expected and send chills down my spine (in a good way) every time I listen to an epic song. I highly suggest getting these.

wires broke on the inside and only played on one side, you get what you pay for
---
I bought a pair of these for the computer. They have very good sound, good isolation, a nice long cord, and are comfortable. They are a great value for the money.
---
I wear these at night, so I don't disturb my neighbors while I watch TV late night. Sound quality is great! And, these were a great value. However, the cable is too short -- I had to buy an extension (and my condo is small). And, I thought these were "around the ear" and not "over or on the ear".
---
Awesome head sets Just knocked off 1 star because the chord is way to long for me and there a little clunky/large. Although they did include a piece to wrap the chord around that I do use.
---
Great sound. I can hear things in my colection that I never heard before (in a good way).

Bought these for $20 with free Prime 2 day shipping. I was excited to get them because of all the good reviews. Mainly got a pair of headphones for the winter so it keeps my ears warm as well as lets me listen to music. Usually I use a pair of Ultimate ears 700 in-ears and these Sennheisers are pretty good. Fit: Out of the box, they are pretty tight, they were a snug fit on my kinda wide head. But I don't get headaches from it. I have used it for a day and they have stretched a bit and are very comfortable now. After a while though, your ears will get a little hot but that wont be a problem if you are like me, getting the headphones for winter to keep warm. Sound/noise cancellation: Coming from a pair of in-ear Ultimate Ears 700, these sound pretty good. Not as good as the UEs but its decent for a pair of $20 headphones. However it is a little bass heavy and sometimes the bass drowns out the vocals. This may be good for some but I like to have a balance, not too much of something. The noise cancellation is great, almost comparable to the in-ears but of course the in-ears would cancel more noise since they are actually in your ear canal. I use these mostly on the train and its the perfect balance between noise cancelling and outside noise. I can't hear other people's conversations and I could hear what stop I am at. Sound leaking is very minimal, unless you are someone that likes to blast their music. In a quiet room, you can barely hear anything coming out when it is at a suitable volume level for that environment. Cable: The cable seems durable, but time will tell. However the cable is very long. It does come with a cable management mechanism where you wrap the cable around a elliptical contraption. It does a good job and keeps the wire wrapped but the contraption itself is kind of on the large side. Overall, for $20, it is a very well made product. I would recommend it. One reason of the main reasons why I like it is cause the sound doesnt leak much, I hate when other people can hear my music. I would recommend this to someone looking for a pair of headphones. 
---
I opted to get the 202 instead of the 201 and boy am I glad. These sound awesome. I heard some people think they are too tight on the head but I think they fit nice. These are no noise reducing however the snug fit does cut out a lot of ambient noise. After a while, my ears start to sweat but when I take them off my ears are sad. For the price they can not be beat! I would recommend these to any music enthusiast.

i have been shopping for over the head headphones that sound amazing and look cool but i didn't wanna spend that much cash. if ur looking for that than these headphones are for u. the cord is extremely long which is good and bad cuz ur have it long enough to do things without suddenly being jerked back however if ur close to the system or whatever its hooked up to the cord could be a little bothersome however sennheiser did provide a clip thing that holds the cord together and it doesn't look weird or nothing and can be removed. the only "problem" was that the jack is made of oxygen free copper rather than 24k gold which does affect the sound a bit and the songs might not sound as good as headphones such as skullcandies that almost all have 24k jacks and the sound is exquisite but this product is super amazing and i for this price its literally a steal. i would definitely recommend it to anyone with $20.
---
great depth and clarity, excellent isolation. for the $ i don't think you can get better cans. the only difference i noticed between these and the higher priced HD series is that you can't remove the cords from the phones.
overall a good value. 
---
Like a lot of other folks the right side stopped working after a year of use. Too bad cause I really liked the product.
---
These were simply too uncomfortable to wear for anything more than 5 minutes. It felt as if my head was in a vise. Got the Grado SR80 instead, which is much more comfortable.
---
I just received the headphones and plugged them into my Ipod Nano. They work and sound great with the Ipod. Snug fit around the ear and they don't feel too tight on me. I used the equalizer on the Ipod and could actually hear the differences, which I really couldn't with the standard ear plugs. I am extremely happy with these and they're a nice alternative to the higher priced models.
---
I work at a radio station, DJ free-lance, and regularly listen to music on the headphones. Basically this model is on my head A LOT. Here's the good: They sound awesome. The average and probably even the discerning listener is really going to enjoy these cans. Also, I find them comfortable for 3-4hrs continued use, and they generally offer good isolation from extracurricular noise.

The bad: Between work, school, and personally I've probably listened to 20 different pairs. I would say the 2-3 year survival rate is about 25%, with the most common cause of death being no sound in one ear. The warranty is limited and doesn't cover anything after a year, and Sennheiser will offer to repair your heaphones, but it costs more than buying a new pair.

That being said, you can probably buy three pairs of HD202 for the cost of a more durable model with equivalent sound quality.

Also I should add that I have experience in electrical engineering and have disassembled broken HD202 only to find the soldered joints INTACT! I did not expect this given the "one ear is dead" symptom. My conclusions is that the actual drivers themselves must be fragile/prone to breakage. 
---
Bass: I am not impressed. I saw a lot of reviews and the product description itself praise for the bass. However, I hear no difference comparing with the cheap headphones. I tried with 5Hz through 200 Hz sound files. At 40-50 Hz, the bass sounded OK, at 30 it sounded decent but below that I heard no bass at all (from 15-25Hz, there was respond, but not bass).

Sound Quality: I sounds good. I am no audio expert so it's the only thing I can say. But, I am not impressed at all. It sounds like a $30-50 headphones. That just it.

Burn In:If someone say "burn-it", I'll say that it won't make anything difference for this headphone. I ran movies, music, game and, pink noise for a decent of time, and the sound quality change little.

Cord: The long cord is nice, I may need it some day, so it is a plus. The cord holder is a little bit big, but it makes sense since the cord is very long.

Durability: I don't know. I bought it last week. I'll edit the post when the headphones break, if I have time.

Price: Almost a steal. You won't find many headphones for $24 that works, let alone a pair that sounds good. I haven't tried the HD201 yet. it is $15,sounds too cheap, I don't want to buy one at that price. Oh, yeah, and 2 years warranty for a headphones at $24 that works. It sounds amazing for me. So definitely a buy.

Comfortableness: It IS small. If you have a big head, you may have problem. The ear cups are small too. Otherwise, it is well-designed and comfortable.

Final words: Don't buy this if you read the reviews and expect a "wow" when you listen to it. DO buy it if you want a pair of headphones that is really cheap, sounds good, has 2 year of warranty from a well-known headphones manufacturer.

my hubby purchased these so he doesn't drive me insane with his music (we have different tastes, LOL). He got them and I gave them a try too - i loved them so much I immediately ordered myself some!

great tone, no distortion, fantastic sound quality!
---
Bought these recently and love them! Sound is great and it blocks out external noise to some degree. No sound leakage either. Cushion is pretty comfortable. For the price, these are the best headphones you can buy. My friend had a pair of Dr. Dre Beats and these were MUCH better (the cushion was better on the Beats, but in every other regard, this headphone pair was much better!) 
---
I got mine for roughly $27 total with shipping. Love it. Ear heats up a bit but for the price, it's great. I can wear it for a good two hours before I start noticing the heat build up. I only use it for work and so carry it in my backpack to and from office work from time to time. Still works.

I am an Electrical Engineer (not specifically an audio engineer). Recently a friend got me interested in headphone listening. I built a low distortion headset amplifier with a three band tone control. The friend loaned me his Sennheiser 650 to try. At $500 it was out of my price range so I thought I would spring for the HD 202 at about $28 including shipping. The 202 is not as comfortable on the ears as the 650 because the ear cups are smaller and intended to fit ON the ear and not AROUND the ear. Both sets seem to be heavy on the bass end and a bit light on the high end. Adjusting the bass down a bit and the treble up a bit they sound VERY good. I recently had an FM broadcast on the headset while typing an Email. The broadcast was of soft semi-classical music and I was thoroughly enjoying it. The announcer came on and I jumped because it sounded as though he was about a foot from my left ear talking to me! Shades of the Bell Telephone binaural audio demonstration at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago many years ago!

There have been over 1000 reviews on this headset, all available on Amazon and dating back several years. I think they have overemphasized the small ear cups. The set is quite comfortable and my ears are not small! The set is very light and easy on the head. I do use the cord reel/clip to shorten the cord and I would prefer something a little shorter, but as someone else pointed out for 1/18 of the price of the 650s, this is an incredible buy!

Note that the set has a 1/8 inch stereo plug but comes with an adaptor 1/8 to 1/4 inch plug.
---
Seinnheiser HD 202 is a great pair of headphones with excellent sound mechanism. Highly recommended.
---
I wanted new headphones for when I watch movies on my laptop while running on the treadmill. I needed a set that 1) blocked out sound (treadmills are noisy!); 2) had excellent sound quality; 3) had a nice long cord (most ear bud sets, I've found, are too short and rip out accidentally from my unfocused movement); and 4) was durable. I am very satisfied with this product in all of these domains, especially when considering its affordability. My only complaint is that the headset size adjustment tweaks too easily. I need it on the smallest size, and it can come loose a couple notches more easily than I'd like. Nothing a little adhesive can't fix, though :) 
---
Just got these headphones this past week. So far, I'm very happy with them. The sound quality exceeds expectations for the price point. Comfortable after a few uses. Does a great job of drowning out the background noise at the office (you know, the guy eating carrots in the next cube). 
---
My primary reason for buying these was I need an inexpensive headphone for my kids to use on long trips for listening to music and watching movies. The earbuds don't fit in their ears very well, and the over-ear headphones help block out airplane noise a bit. They have performed perfectly well in the purpose for which I bought them. The one reason for giving these four stars is that I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 pro headphones, and the HD 280s are clearly superior in their sound quality. (There are a number of design features I like better, too, but I wouldn't expect those in a headphone at this price). The HD 202 is much more limited in both low and high frequency ranges, while the mid bass range sounds a bit too loud to my ears. 
---
this is my first headphones and so far so good... the sound quality is very good and the headset are very comfortable. 
---
These are it! - they block/muffle a significant amount of outside noise and I wanted something that would do that while listening to my Kelly Howell cds - sometimes I even fall asleep with these on. The headphones are very comfortable and sturdy. The music comes through crystal clear. I Really like these and for the price they are great!
---
This Headset is really good except two things: it does not cover you ear properly (very discomforting if you use for long hours) and secondly, there is no volume control. These two features I believe are fundamental of a headset and should be taken care of even before I start talking about sound quality (which is very good). Please do not compare this product to Sony or Bose. Bose and Sony are much better, but the price is also six times this one.

Over all, I would suggest you not to buy this item. Try Philip or Sony under $50.
---
The headphones are good for its price.

Pros - very good sound quality, really long chord, good noise isolation.

Cons - quite uncomfortable if you have larger ears like I do. You have to sorta continuously find the optimum position over your ears to make sure they don't hurt/become numb after awhile.

Overall a good buy for its price. 
---
Nothing better in its class. True they get uncomfortable after about an hour, but I have felt this in any headphone I have used. They DONT get HOT, this is also not as big of an issue as others seem to stress. The headphones are easily adjustable, have a sleek style, and produce a wide-deep sound range. Sound is well above average for headphones in its price range. I would buy another pair in a heartbeat, 5 Stars. 
---
I'll admit that the reviews were what sold me to buy these headphones, also in that they only cost $24. Really amazing headphones, honestly. After a whole days worth of use, it is great sound and they fit so comfortably. The only downside is trying to keep this portable, I have a hard time trying to wrap up the whole cable. But nevertheless, it is a great product. The bass is actually surprisingly good. I used the Beats by Dre Studio Version, and that blew me away. These aren't anywhere close to the bass, but the bass is reasonable. If you listen to Rock/Indie music, you probably won't notice too much. But for the Hip-Hop fans, the bass is pretty reasonable. Love these headphones. If they ever get worn out, I'll most likely BUY another set just because they're so cheap. 
---
I had the Sony MDR-XD200's for about 5 minutes. I just gave them away when my HD202's came. Very comfortable, and you can wear them with glasses. Great sound isolation. Buy them. 
---
These are great! I got them REALLY fast from seller! Great Job!

Sound is Amazing.. I listen to music from Freestyle to Disturbed and Hollywood Undead.
All the music is great... I think they are very loud... some might disagree...
Get them worth morth then $20.00
---
Agree with most of the comments here. Headphones have great, nuanced sound. Very comfortable for long use. And they block out ambient sound nicely. However, one of the cords has already frayed and I am now getting sound in only one ear. This has happened after only six months of use. Unacceptable design flaw. The headphones are now useless. 
---
Pretty comfortable, I wish the ear cup was slightly larger. The sound quality is fairly good but if you want to listen to some music with a heavy bass such as dubstep or some other kinds of electronic music then you might be slightly disappointed in the bass output on the headphones. Also, the wire is annoyingly long. When I'm walking around with the headphones I have to stuff a lot of the wire into my pockets or else I'd be tripping all over it. Otherwise they're comfortable and pretty good for the price.

I was looking for a pair of headphones just for everyday usage and these seem to fit those requirements pretty well. I'm going to be purchasing another pair of Sennheisers with a slightly larger earcup as well. What can I say I'm a headphone fanatic! 
---
When the box said "Strong Bass", they meant it. Don't pay mind to the marketing team's generic word replacements, like "strong stereo" and "dynamic" and all that other bull. What you gotta look for is "great base/treble balance".

These phones, while very comfortable to wear, are a nightmare to listen to. Not that they're THAT bad, but they're JUST for bass. If you want to listen to nothing but bass beats, buy this now. If you listen to REAL music, don't give these a second thought. The bass is just overpowering and with the (still comfortable) seal it makes around the ear, the pressure sort of hurts if you're playing music too long. But that's just me. Maybe I'm a priss. I dunno. But I know classical, techno, jazz, and rock, and this made that music......simply put: sound bad.

Pros: Comfortable, nice price for the size and materials used, LONG cord

Con: Not music headphones--BASS headphones. Remember this.

I'm returning mine tomorrow.
---
some of the best headphones I have had in years. they are not totally noise canceling but they do a great job of putting you in your own environment. the price is unbeatable! 
---
I have several pairs of the Sennheiser HD201 that I really like so I thought I'd give these a try too. Whereas the 201s fit over the ear, the 202s fit on the ear. Phones that fit on the ear are less comfortable for me as they press my ears to my head and eventually they start to hurt. The sound quality of these cans is good but it's heavy on the bass. A lot of folks might like that, I don't. I prefer a more level response so I can adjust the EQ on my playback device. I think a lot of people would be happy with this purchase and you can't beat the price. 
---
The Sennheiser HD 202 headphones are really great for its price when it was $23 on amazon from a few weeks ago. You know, I could give you cons and pros that would be only my opinion, and you wouldn't set your mind if I did. So instead, I will just give my review. First, these are really great headphones; good sound quality, you could barely hear anything outside; Connectivity, a lot better then earphones that have short length but this headphone has a long one, which is why it's a benefit, and knowing where the company came from [Germany], I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. Second, the bad thing about these headphones is that it has a long cord, which is a bit of a drag (that's why I gave it a 4 out of 5), even though it has an item, where you could wrap the wire to; it's still annoying, I would recommend the wireless rechargable Sennhesier headphones, hence, wireless and rechargable, I only got these headphones because it was cheap. Lastly, these headphones are really comfortable, even if you have long ears, you could just adjust them by pulling down. As far as the durability goes, it was a wet a little bit and it still worked like it never was wet, but I just had this for only a month, so I will update this review.

Whether, if this review helped you or not, or even bothered to read it; if you get anything from this review, just remember, you can't go wrong with cheap and great headphones.

Thank you for reading as I enjoyed writing it.

These headphones were great, I purchased them off amazon for $19 and for what I got it doesn't get much better than that. However after a short 7 months the right ear shorted out for no apparent reason. Unfortunately I can't find the packaging so I could not redeem my sennheiser 2 year warranty :(. Although I did use them a good 2 hours a day which sometimes included sleeping in them so I guess I can not complain to much considering they were only 19 bucks. It will probably be a good while until I buy again from this company.

Pros:
highs
mids
comfort
plastic piece to wrap excess cord

Cons:
bass was decent but not what I would've hoped with the boasted "powerful bass response"
durability, not only was the cord not durable the entire plastic frame is delicate and must be handled with care
the removable ear pieces are actually a con because they take away from the durability and comfort
distortion was noticeable when the equalizer was altered or when they were turned up high.

Neutral:
cord length
volume
noise isolation
portability
looks

Overall: These are great headphones if you are on a budget and looking for some decent headphones to use every once and a while for casual music listening, but if you are looking for something to use daily and want to use everywhere I would search elsewhere. 
---
I would have thought these headphones would cost double what they did. The sound is great, not top of the line, but that only matters if you're an audiophile. The cushions are comfy and the quality of assembly is great. The long cord is useful if you need it (I mainly don't but the option is there, coiled up around the belt clip). I have several pairs of 'cheaper' headphones and these didn't cost much more than the others but are far superior in every way. 
---
In many ways, I say yes, they do. They truly are good headphones at a pretty great price. They are extremely versatile. I remember I bought a pair 3 years ago and they were going to be my "gaming headphones". I could game until all hours of the night with these things. Then one day, in my high school, I see some kid walking around in the hallway with these same headphones around his neck listening to some kind of bass-bumpin rap. Thought it was pretty amusing, and it shows how many different uses these have. The bass is its main feature, and you can definitely hear and FEEL a difference from standard computer speakers. I often had my sister coming into my room asking if she could listen to her song with MY HEADPHONES! haha. Music, gaming, business, public or home use are all fantastic with these sleek looking, high quality headphones. Other plus's include a very long cord, nice adjust-ability, and fairly comfortable. Being a gamer, I will never claim that these are 100% comfortable because ... after 3 hours of use, your ears are gonna throb. Dont let that discourage you, since most headphones worn that long are painful. I must say however, I have small ears, and if I put the headband, not ontop of, but BEHIND my head ... My ears fit snug and Ive been known to wear it like that for 5 + hours without pain or discomfort. Wierd I know, but all in all, these get 7.5/10 comfort.

Now, as Ive said, Ive had these 3 years. I used these headphones between 3 and 6 hours every single day ... they replaced my computer speakers. And I do not like to leave reviews until the item has gone bad, which these (finally) have. At first I was bummed when the left speaker started cracking and then went silent, but in truth, these were put through gaming torture. Sound cranked to 10/10, feeling -not just hearing- the footsteps of an enemy creeping up, bombs-grenades-rifle fire BOOM! These things have seen it all and lasted surprising long. My last headphones ( SONIC HP-259 Circumaural Stereo Headset ) were about 20 dollars and lasted 7 months.

I must confess, I will NOT be buying these headphones for my third pair. I loved the sound quality and the comfort + lifespan were good, but I really prefer having a full headset. Earphones + mic in one is soooo nice leaving you hands free for gaming or live chat etc. Music lovers, and gamers who dont use voice over, or even for work, will love these headphones for a span of no less than 2.5-4 years.
