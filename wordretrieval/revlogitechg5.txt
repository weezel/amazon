This was the greatest gaming mouse I had ever used. Simple and "comfy". It had a failure of the right button, which would insert a double right-click nearly every other press of the button. Settings and re-installation of the driver did nothing. Other Logitech mice worked fine with the same driver and settings. Logitech of course refused to acknowledge a failure of the device and assumed my settings were inaccurate, regardless my efforts to trouble shoot. I had to quit using it and I would not buy another at this price ... why pay Zippo prices for a Bic lighter?

I have owned this mouse for about a year and a half and I absolutely am in love with it. The side buttons are great for in game macros and the adjustable dpi is a great feature. The only complaints I have are that the smaller of the two side buttons became unresponsive after about a year of use and after a year and a half the usb on the mouse is dieing and it is becoming very faulty. Provided a good time of use however.

there aren't enough buttons. I want more buttons. and the grip isn't as good as the razor mouse. 
---
this mouse is awesome! adjustable DPI, attached weight cartridge, stylish look, laser tech, man this is what you dreamed for! also, if you are a serious gamer, good at like SC2, WC3, WOW, etc, plz get WIRED mouse like this and avoid wireless ones ever!!! I owned a MX1100, cant say that's a dud but it really sucks when you play warcraft though it applies adjustable DPI and laser as well.

I really love this mouse. It has many good attributes: 1) the size of it fits the hand very well, 2) the weights that you can add or take out let you configure it to be heavy or not (depending on how you like it), 3) it has 3 speeds for tracking which are VERY handy, 4) the 2 thumb buttons are just an absolute great idea and have come in very handy for certain games, 5) the fact the mousewheel itself has TWO EXTRA positions (it can be clicked to the left or right!) is absolutely AWESOME if you're into MMO's, and 6) the fact that almost all the buttons are CONFIGURABLE with macros to do just exactly what you want is probably by far the best part about it.

It's also VERY durable (I've accidentally bumped it off my desk a few times now) and the cord is, also (the cord has a special material that encompasses it and where once when I knocked it off my desk, it scraped what was a sharp edge and took ZERO DAMAGE)! I also love the fact that it HAS a cord and is not cordless (for those that don't like having to replace batteries at the most inopportune times).

Overall it's hands down THE BEST gaming mouse I've ever owned. PERIOD.

I paid $149.00 for this item through Amazon by "The Elesctronic Pro". I received the mouse and found it too big for me to navigate. I returned the opened item with all accessories and received a partial refund after using it once. I later found the IDENTICAL mouse again through Amazon for $49.00. Just BEWARE who you buy this from and steer clear of "The Electronic Pro". 
---
This is, simply, the best gaming mouse ever made. The. Best. Nothing that Razer or Microsoft or Saitek or anyone else makes even comes close. 
---
I think others have said it all already so Ill make it short:
-Great accuracy with 2000 dpi
-the cord is perfect. Its not some cheap rubber covering like most which has made it last over 2 years for me and is still strong.
-incredibly durable (i have dropped it a few times while moving things and it still performs as new)

You will not regret buying this.

Great responsiveness, I love the on-the-fly DPI adjustment. With the Logitech Setpoint software you can set the 3 different on-the-fly settings to whatever your heart desires (up to 2k that is). Been using mine for ~6 months now and the "feet" on the mouse are still smooth and friction free on my rocketfish mousepad (I use the control side). Plenty of buttons which can be reprogrammed also. Fits my hand really well...not the most ergonomic design but it's simple and comfortable for hours of continuous usage. I'd say it's best for people with slightly smaller hands compared to other gaming mice that I've tried. Braided USB wire is a nice touch. Interchangeable weight cartridge is a nice feature for customization...I leave mine empty for a nice, light feel. Good, solid construction, I have no doubt this thing will last for years. 
---
I am going to do something Amazon probably wont like...I am going to recommend you go to eBay to get this. Prices are usually in the $20 or $30 range and most of them are used but in good condition. The $170+ prices listed here are retarded.

You cannot find this new anymore. For some reason Logitech decided to discontinue the best mouse they have ever produced. This is sold as a gaming mouse, but really, It is a dream for everyday use and (especially) graphics work. The weight system is simply awesome, and greatly enhances precision work. I wish it was standard on all mice. The cordless version (the G7) lacks the weight system and you can see the difference.

I do own newer more "modern" Logitech mice. Logitech still makes the best mice, but nothing so far that is as good as the G5. 
---
The Logitech G5 is an excellent mouse for the average gamer- It is accurate, has a good DPI, and has on-the fly DPI adjustments. The overall feel of the mouse is excellent, although it may take time to get used to it.

The only gripe I have about this mouse is the deteriorating scroll button. Over time, I have had it make wierd clicking noises while scrolling (separate from the normal noise when it scrolls). It eventually went away, but now I find the scroll button very sensitive. Just touching it slightly will make the page you are viewing go down. In all cases, it is probably just a problem with my own mouse. I am hoping Logitech will respond to me support ticket real soon. :)

In the long run, this mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. You won't be disappointed.

Awesome mouse, made the purchase for my Boss, CEO/President and he LOVES it.
He is a gamer and needs an hi resolution mouse for several graphic programs, he has been using it a lot and made the other day with a big smile on his face, THIS IS AN AWESOME MOUSE I LIKE IT VERY MUCH, hi is very computer safy so 5 stars all over, oh he does not use the weights.
So all stars all the way, good buy just wish it were a much cheaper mouse.
---
I've used a G5 mouse for a year before the right button gave out after a drop off my desk. Coming to Amazon.com to get a new one, I was astounded to see this mouse at first $176, now it's lowered to $140!? I bought this very same mouse at Best Buy for about $50 brand new in the box. How in the hell you can justify a markup of this amount is insane. DO NOT buy this mouse for anything over $70 tops, simply a stupid price tag. 
---
PROS: Great button placement, wheel works really well in-game, love the on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment.
CONS: Sometimes is painful after holding it. Maybe I played too much?
FINAL VERDICT: Definitely worth the money. If you game and are looking for a gaming mouse, this is it.
SUMMARY: Bought this after looking at online reviews, and many people seemed to like it. It has a great feel to it, lots of grip, has this crazy little tray of adjustable weights that pops out the bottom so I can adjust how heavy it is. But occasionally this tray will fall out. I love the software that comes with it, makes the mouse fully customizable. It is lighting quick too, an advantage over wireless mice that sometimes can lag out on you. (Which is not good in multiplayer) One of the edges is a bit sharp and depending on how you hold the mouse, can get painful if you're not careful. Try a few positions out, keep gaming sessions under 10 hours and you'll be fine.

This has been my main mouse for over 3 years and it's still working great! It truly is one of the best mice out there. It has been used on hundreds of PC games, and it has never failed me. The on-the-fly sensitivity buttons are extremely useful in games like Battlefield 2142 where you need to increase and decrease sensitivity in order to gain an advantage. The shape is the most comfortable one for my hand. I can use the mouse for 6 hours straight and my hand will not feel tired. The buttons themselves are extremely responsive and easy to click. Even the scroll wheel which has received a lot of bad rep from gamers works great on my mouse. I can middle click effortlessly and without mistakenly tilting the wheel.

Didn't really care much for the weights. I simply inserted all the heavier units and left it at that. The tracking itself is superb. I have tried many many other mice (no gaming mice however) and none of them are accurate as this one. It never becomes a hindrance when aiming at the enemies in FPS shooters. If I ever upgrade this one, I would opt for the Logitech G500 (as opposed to G9) due to the familiar shape. Highly, HIGHLY recommended! 
---
Extremely pleased with this mouse. I had owned many "starter" mice and even some Razers, but nothing compares to the G5.

From the add-on weights to the programmable buttons to the on-the-fly sensitivity changing, this mouse has it all.

I love it, and will buy Logitech mice for life. 
---
The mouse feels great, but there is one HUGE problem:
it is impossible to use the middle button without accidentally pressing the side scroll buttons too(which makes firefox go forward/back one page, for example).

Also, it is 2010 already and Logitech still does not provide Linux support. How can they be so cheap? Just hire __one__ linux programmer to do the job.

I am returning this mouse because the middle mouse does not work properly and there are no configuration utilities provided from Logitech. I am not looking forward 2 days of trying different xorg config settings trying to disable the extra buttons.

Logitech G5 Laser Mouse is pretty cool. I'm using it right now. made for gamers. tired of getting shot at and can't seem to turn around to save yourself. well with this mouse you can. it has adjustable speed. also really good for sniping your opponent. also customize the weight on the mouse is pretty neat. 
---
This mouse has been pretty good for 2 years.
Pros: 3 year Warranty, Logitech support, weight, style, and features are worth the money.
Cons: The mouse sensitivity would occasionally change between applications. The DPI buttons required harder and harder pushing to respond as it got older. Finally the mouse cord, where it connects to the circuit board, came loose and would make the mouse lose connection to the USB port.

I called Logitech support and got a copy of my receipt off Amazon, and Logitech is shipping me a new G500 (because they don't sell the G5 anymore).

I would buy it again.

When laser mice first came out (obviously at a premium to regular optical mice), I was quite skeptical. But after buying 2 Logitech G5 laser mice (and one Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse (Black)), I must say that they have changed my life (at least the bits of it that related to sitting in front of a computer 10 hours a day). The G5 is fast, very precise, and works on virtually any surface. The feature where you can change resolution (amount of distance the cursor moves every inch you move the mouse) very easily on the fly between 5 settings (mine are set from 300dpi all the way to a staggering 1800dpi). This feature is also very useful if you like to waste your time playing online games where a mouse is required. For games like billiards you need a very low resolution to aim precisely while for other games the ability to move the mouse quickly (or move a high resolution mouse slowly) counts for a lot. Once you buy this mouse and get used to the cursor moving with laser precision where you want it to go, you will never use an optical or mechanical mouse for the rest of your life. The mouse also has an adjustable weight tray so you can tweak its weight to your liking. Again, this seems like a small thing but becomes somewhat important if you use your mouse for multiple hours a day.

Was very interested in the G5/G7, but was put off by the fact that they only have one thumb button. So when I found out that they came out with a revision with 2, I was all over it. Love the mouse. Unfortunately only comes in one finish (the electric crackly blue one), but it's not as gaudy as the pictures make it seem.

The adjustable weights are nice, and the dpi switcher is very snazzy. The middle mouse click can be tricky to push down, as it sometimes prefers tilting to the sides. I'm glad it has the ratchety precision scroll, but the option to switch between it and hyperscroll would have been nice.

Otherwise, a great mouse. Highly recommended for the price. 
---
This is an excellent mouse that I bought at the recommendation of a friend. I have had zero issues with it and it is very precise. DPI goes up to 2000. I recommend getting it with a hard-surfaced gaming mouse pad such as SteelSeries. 
---
I would recommend this company to any customer looking for a product. They were very professional and responded to inquiries quickly. The first mouse had been lost in the mail and they sent out a replacement within 24 hours. The mouse arrived safely and works very well. 
---
My logitech wireless mouse died and I had a few problems with connection issues. So I decided I would go back to a wire mouse. I want a mouse that had almost the exact same button setup as my wireless mouse. Friend of mine has the MX5** version. I was looking for that one put I didn't chose it because of the color schemes that amazon was selling at the time. I am very picky. So I went with the G5 instead. I am very happy that I bought this mouse instead. I played with the weights to get the mouse the right fell when playing FPS's, and works for everything else I play on the PC also. 
---
This is quite possibly the best mouse I've ever had. I used to use it at school a lot and really liked it, as they had these in one of the computer labs there. After my old mouse died on me, I decided to give this one a try since I had already used it before and found it to be much better.
I've found the DPI switching buttons to be much easier to reach compared to the other mice I've used before as well (on my old mouse they were on the right side of the mouse, which I found to be quite hard to get to sometimes).
I also like the amount of control I get over what those settings are, rather than being locked to a few specific settings. You can adjust each setting in 50-DPI increments, which is a very nice feature.
I also like the ability to add weights to make the mouse a bit heavier. 
---
Logitech G5 Laser Mouse (Blue/Black) A nice mouse. It does feel more solid than just a typical one. Some positive aspects include weights, speed and the ability to slide and scroll. By a preferred choice, I loaded the mouse with as much weight as I could. It actually made it feel not only more durable but accurate. For speed, there is a gaming console type control center to really tweak them. Not worth my time since I focus more on office work than gaming. With each of the basic speeds being quite different from each other, it wasn't hard to find just the right one. A very nice touch was the shifting from side to side with the scroll button. It's easy to find the bar, click on it, hold and slide it as you read OR just keep your eye on the text and push to the side. At times, the settings found their own way switching for no reason. Easily fixed but a bit annoying. There were several aspects that are not mentioned in other reviews. Although the buttons are programmable, they are limited to a short list of choices. No Start Menu or Home Page are just a couple of needed settings that would of been helpful. All in all, a nice mouse with added features to make it worth somewhat the price. 
---
Great mouse and worth every dollar. 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the texture of the surface on the top. It looks a feels like cracked paint. Not suitable for an electronic precision device.

Anyone should have this mouse. Its not only for games as Logitec pitches it. 
---
Great for gaming. I'm not a mouse fanatic, so i dont know what to say. If you're anything like me, you wont even bother with that on the fly dpi switching. i guess it's good for graphic design, but even then, anyone whose serious about that should use a pen tablet. as for gaming, like TF2 or Counterstrike, yes, the on-the-fly DPI switch does allow for more precision... but the buttons are in a position that it will take some movement and time to press. Not worth it in fast paced games such as those.

The side buttons are nice. So is the texture. And the weight, too.
I say if you have the money to spend, get this one. Afterall, when it came out, it WAS like a $150 mouse or something. 
---
Great mouse! I had the previous version and loved it. This one adds a button and feels even better to the touch. I now own three for all my computers. I'm not a gamer, but find the precision and on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment helpful for photo work and other exacting tasks. And, it just feels GREAT in the hand. Significantly improves the computing experience.

In comparison to the G9:
I was using a Logitech MX510 prior to this mouse. The MX510 was over 3 years old and started having issues with the sensor and since I liked that style this seemed like a natural match. I ordered the G5 alongside the G9 to compare and contrast the top contenders. Overall the only real difference in usage are the scroll wheel on the G9 and the types of grips offered. I personally preferred the way the wheel moved on the G9 but clicking it was weird to me and the G5 offered a nice familiar feel so I preferred it. The grip on the G9 is really different as well as it bulges in the palm area, I personally am a fan of how the G5 fits. Overall I recommend the buyer try both for at least a few days and pick the one that suits their grip the best.

Impressions of this mouse:
I personally have not found much use for the adjustable sensitivity, I mostly do FPS games and I might practice with it a little more in the future. The finish of the mouse also surprised me, compared to other Logitech products including my former MX510 and the Wide body G9 grip the G5 used a rough hard plastic versus a rubber coat. This took some time getting used to, but overall this seems to be better than the rubber grip as it probably won't wear down as easily and won't be as susceptible to sweat and oil to allow for a constant firm grip.

Overall it is a solid mouse, the laser sensor and buttons are great along with real nice mousefeet which should give a nice smooth feel for a long time to come. Pair it with a proper mouse pad and prepare to dominate.
